Grateful Dead Reviews

Note: Dates from 65-67 may be slightly wrong.
      This is because I tried to listen to everything, and I'm sure I repeated bits of music because the labelling
      on those early shows is often up for debate.

1: In general, the best sound source was selected for each show (almost always a soundboard).
2: The whole show was listened to.
3: The rating means "What do I think of the SHOW":
    1:   Unlistenable.
    2:   Terrible.
    3:   Not a good show.
    3.5: An average show.
    4:   This show has some good stuff.
    4.5: A proper GD show that I suggest you listen to.
    5:   The cream of the crop.


Things I have learnt:

1: Sound quality is king.
2: The set list is important.


Date        Score  Comments
====        =====  ========
01-11-65    2   Cassidy + Warlocks, circa late 1965. Possibly worst sound ever. Also, date is wrong.
03-11-65    3.5 Scorpion records outakes. Great studio stuff. Hard to rate, obviously.

08-01-66    3   Acid test madness. Not as messy as you'd think. Jerry is great.
29-01-66    1.5 Listed as a GD show. Is this the Dead? Interviews are interesting, music is not musical.
05-02-66    3   LA studio rehearsals. Lots of snippets. Viola Lee is long and jammed. Rest is pretty boring.
12-02-66    3.5 Watts acid tests. The Jerry + Pig show. Everbody else mixed too low.
25-02-66    2   No jams, more like Pigpen raps. Singing can be bad.
12-03-66    4   Probably wrong data, maybe December? Still, it's 3 complete songs. Nice quality and it's on point.
09-03-66    3.5 Labelled "LA Practice", but who knows? Surprisingly open to jamming, and a nice relaxed feel.
10-03-66    3   Studio snippets again. Great quality. Fast and furious, and pretty short as well.
12-03-66    3   Same as a previous show, I think
25-03-66    3.5 Mix was Jerry, keys and drums! A long Pig solo as well
19-05-66    3   So, young Bobby can't sing!
??-06-66    1.5 Many small outakes. No real full songs. Boring. Possibly same as next entry.
01-06-66    2   "Birth Of The Dead". Very repetitive takes. Studio quality is good again, so it has that.
15-06-66    4.5 "Live at Various". Great quality from the Dead Hour. They even sound like a good band!
01-07-66    2   Short and not inspiring.
03-07-66    1.5 Short, cuts, zero jams. Talking is best part.
16-07-66    3.5 First Jerry ballad. Schoolgirl was proto-jamming.
17-07-66    2   Short, not that sweet. Haven't heard any Phil yet really.
29-07-66    3   Not too shabby. First Canadian gig.
30-07-66    2.5 Second Canadian gig, but first was better. Similar though.
01-08-66    3   Possibly April 66'. Only 3 songs (1 repeated). Ideal for Pigpen fans - essentially long raps.
16-09-66    4   Alright, this sounds like a slightly different band. Is this date correct?
02-10-66    3   Not really GD at all. Apparently Jerry is on the organ. Too much dialog. Weird, some parts are good.
07-10-66    3   A little too short. But sound is better than early part of the year.
31-10-66    -   Pretty sure this is not the Grateful Dead. 9 minute instrumental jam.
19-11-66    3   Novelty of 1966 has worn off, but this is a bit better.
29-11-66    2.5 Quality a bit dodgy. Full show, like 2 first sets.
01-12-66    3.5 Elements of some jamming happening here, but not a lot.
05-12-66    3   High energy (sped up?), no vocals, reasonable fun.
04-12-66    3.5 Seems like a complete show. 3 full sets. Very very good view of 1966, quality is acceptable.
xx-xx-66    3.5 Grateful Dead Hour broadcast. Sounds very early. Nice Caution.
xx-xx-66    2   Primal GD Gems. Heard before. Mix is very poor, almost no vocals.
xx-xx-66    2.5 'Jools' - 2/66? Short, a bit hissy. Mix is ok though.
xx-xx-66    2.5 'Wanderin' Man' song session. Good quality. Strange song from a studio session.

14-01-67    3   Human Be-In. Lively, sound not bad.
27-01-67    2.5 Horrible audience with lots of energy. Date is probably wrong.
12-02-67    3   Great quality, but far too short to really rate.
18-03-67    3.5 Not too shabby, best 67 yet, SQ was decent as well.
08-04-67    2   Fragment of TV(?) show. Tiny, annoying fragments. Interview is best.
05-05-67    4   Powerful, full of energy, best early jam so far.
18-06-67    4   Best jam so far! Just raw energy, needs a little direction.
23-07-67    3   Neil Cassidy backed by the Dead. There's a strange combo. More the former than the latter.
04-08-67    4   Monster 20 minute Viola Lee. Jerry hints at space at the end.
05-08-67    3.5 Similar to last show. Just getting short clips right now.
03-09-67    3.5 Some nice jammin' on Alligator, Pig rap a little long though.
04-09-67    4   Tiny snippet with first feedback jam.
15-09-67    3   Terrible aud. Dreadful sound, some jams are on point.
20-10-67    4   Recording sessions. Hissy, but well worth it. First Cryptical.
22-10-67    4   Morning Dew start! Such a difference from a year ago.
31-10-67    -   This is actuall cuts from 10/11 Nov, even though it is often listed as a show.
10-11-67    3.5 Nice quality, jams not as frantically bad-ass as recent ones
11-11-67    3   Nothing really grabbed me from the show.
14-11-67    4   Studio outakes. Sounds well orchestrated. First Dark Star! Very short.
xx-xx-67    4   Studio outakes (Etree #81259). Like the above, quite enjoyable.

17-01-68    4.5 Very short Dark Star. Best feedback jam so far, which is why so high.
20-01-68    3.5 Another Dark Star. Which is cut! Quite short.
22-01-68    4   First real Dark Star. Kinda sounding like the GD a bit. Jammy.
23-01-68    4   Horrible cut, nice sound, nice jams.
27-01-68    4   Sounds like the end of 23-01, from where it cuts. Very short.
02-02-68    3.5 Short and jammy. 68' seems to sound very similar after a while.
14-02-68    4   Nice, and a bit trippy at points.
03-02-68    3.5 Early Eleven, surprisingly laid-back I thought.
16-03-68    3.5 Nice sound, jamming a little uneven.
29-03-68    3   A bit muddy, and nothing stood out for me.
30-03-68    3   A lot of similar shows here. Jamming needs some kick of a sort.
31-03-68    4   Nice feedback jam, more snippets though...
18-05-68    4   Some screwed up conversation at the end. Harder jamming.
14-06-68    3.5 Horrible aud. First St Stephen. Sounds crazy loud.
21-08-68    4   Very clear Phil. Nice sound. Pigpen bits drag on. Jams are good.
23-08-68    4   Nice Caution > Feedback. Less Pigpen raps is good for me.
02-09-68    5   Great start into Star. Fine space. Betty Nelsons Organic Raspberry Farm!
20-09-68    2   36 minutes, 26 of which is drums!
12-10-68    4.5 Great show, but no Pigpen?
13-10-68    4.5 Still no Pigpen on these shows. They sound great though.
06-11-68    1.5 Studio rehearsals. Many tedious snippets of "The Eleven".
07-12-68    3   "You have just been victimised by the Grateful Dead" says Jerry. So-so.
21-12-68    4   Not bad, could have been better though. A little spacey, not so much fire.
29-12-68    4   Tasty. Everything coming together nicely.
xx-xx-68    3   Midnight Hour only (id: 97671). Mostly a Pig rap.
xx-xx-68    3.5 Un-labbeled vault tapes (id: 9426); many shows, all very similar for 68.

17-01-69    3   Really kind of washed over me. These shows are like never-ending jams.
24-01-69    4   Comes with mad audience drumming chants. Also ends with drums...?
25-01-69    4   The madness is real.
26-01-69    4   Sound quality issues are pretty bad for first 5 minutes though.
02-02-69    3.5 Shows now seem to lack any stand-alone normal songs.
04-02-69    4   Nice jamming, although Jerry complains a bit.
05-02-69    4.5 Short and crushing.
06-02-69    4   Nice, though previous night was better
07-02-69a   4   Early show. Short, Dark Star was the highlight.
07-02-69b   3.5 Short songs, although they all jam.
12-02-69    4.5 Nice fiery Alligator. No song seems to stand alone.
14-02-69    4   Bad sound but show wasn't bad.
15-02-69    5   Good development of the Dark Star, and feels almost like a full show.
21-02-69    4.5 Long songs, and Lovelight was a little too long. But DS + Eleven both good.
22-02-69    4   Tough to rate these shows as they all have similar formats and songs.
15-03-69    4.5 Cracking Dark Star. These DS are really starting to develop.
22-03-69    3.5 Cut short, and not very exciting.
28-03-69    4.5 Great Dark Star, rest a little rushed.
29-03-69    3.5 Fade out at end. SQ is good, but music needs more inspiration.
04-04-69    4.5 Very good show, lovely Eleven > Feedback.
05-04-69    4.5 Nice long show.
06-04-69    3.5 Some songs not jammed! Power is switched off in encore.
11-04-69    3.5 Terrible quality from Dark Star onwards.
12-04-69    4.5 Another good Dark Star - the highlight, really.
13-04-69    4   Enjoyable, not so much ragged energy. Cuts, unfortunatly.
14-04-69    3.5 Too short to tell you much. China Cat is back though!
18-04-69    3   Nothing stand-out, really, and a few more short songs. A bit messy.
20-04-69    4   Only major dissapointment was the Lovelight.
21-04-69    4   First set too many short songs, and DS did not stand out. Otherwise good.
22-04-69    4.5 That's a proper show. 69 jamming is a little similar, though
23-04-69    3.5 Something about this didn't inspire me. Setlists are starting to change though.
25-04-69    3   Mainly a massive Lovelight, and a terrible Yellow Dog story.
26-04-69    3.5 These Lovelights are getting longer and longer.
07-05-69    3.5 Jerry singing Good Lovin'! Jeez these Lovelights go on forever.
10-05-69    4   The highlights are mainly the Dark Stars in these shows.
11-05-69    4.5 The tape warbles, cuts, shakes and smokes energy.
16-05-69    2.5 Very short, no real jams. Not a lot to see here.
23-05-69    4   Star through 11 was very good, unfortunatly a 30 minute Lovelight again.
24-05-69    4   Starts with 30 minutes of Lovelight! But the ending was good.
29-05-69    4   Terrible quality in large areas, but the Other One suite was pretty energetic.
31-05-69    4.5 Better quality and better Lovelight both help in this nice show.
05-06-69    5   Relaxed pacing, tunes, melodies... a nice show in admist the chaos.
06-06-69    2.5 No Jerry until the final Lovelight! This must be unique.
07-06-69    3.5 First ever acoustic and Janis on Lovelight, but nothing musically stand-out.           
08-06-69    2   Worst Lovelight. Slowest Other One. Missing the band in parts!
13-06-69    3.5 A bit of flute somewhere. The Lovelights continue to be a bit lazy.
14-06-69    3.5 Lovelight 3 times? Seems to be 2 shows joined.
21-06-69    2.5 First set abysmal quality. Second set short, dominated by Lovelight.
27-06-69    4   Nice Dark Star is the single highlight. Some strange songs.
28-06-69    2   Some strange songs and a subdued (but 30 minutes!) Lovelight. No highlights.
04-07-69    3   Bit of a mixed bag; slower, with less energy. I actually almost enjoyed the Lovelight.
05-07-69    4   Nice Dark Star in there, some decent jamming.
07-07-69    5   First Dark Star to lose itself to some degree. Great show.
11-07-69    4.5 Nice show, and it seemed to contain a first set as well.
12-07-69    3   Rough quality at the start. Not much value compared to previous shows.
02-08-69    4   A nice mellow Other One. But yet another 30 minute lovelight...!!
03-08-69    3.5 The saxaphone is not good in places. Violin can barely be heard.
16-08-69    2.5 Woodstock. No real spark, and a long ass break in the middle.
21-08-69    4   Quite mellow, and an improvement. With added flute on some tracks.
23-08-69    5   Best Dark Star so far, even the massive Lovelight was good. Solid show.
29-08-69    3   Jerry sings Good Lovin'. Dominated by a massive Lovelight.
30-08-69    4   Good Dark Star, although the rest is a bit hit and miss.
01-09-69
06-09-69    2.5 Another Jerry Good Lovin'. Fragments of a show?
25-10-69    4   Some sound issues, and it could do with a little more fire.
26-10-69    3   Nice but predictable. Like a first set.
31-10-69    3.5 Sound quality is bad. Mostly like a first set again, except stupid long Lovelight.
01-11-69    3   New songs, more first-set like. But nothing stood out here.
02-11-69    4   Nice Dark Star, rest needs a little more fire.
07-11-69    4   Although it does have the Star > Other One > Lovelight combo!
15-11-69    2.5 Terrible quality. Washington's teeth story. 42 minute Lovelight.
21-11-69    2.5 Lots of hiss, no big jams.
26-12-69    4   Billy misses first set. First acoustic set? Strange, but Star saves the day!
28-12-69    4   No massive jams, but its punchy sound and great dialogue make this worth it.
29-12-69    4   Jams appearing in some new songs straight out the box. Wildly different from early '69.
30-12-69    3.5 Nasty cut in Dark Star towards the end but quite nice fun.
31-12-69    3.5 Lacks a little something, and the order is a bit strange.

02-01-70    4.5 Cracking little show to start off the year, despite a nasty Dark Star cut.
03-01-70    4   Another nice show. Sound quality seems to have improved a little.
10-01-70    3   Decent Lovelight but the rest was so-so.
16-01-70    3   Nothing too stand out, although the shows are acquiring a different flavour to them.
17-01-70    4   Nice show, good Star
23-01-70    4.5 Lovely pace and progression. Dark Stars getting even better.
24-01-70    3   Only about half a set in this show, no major jams but sounds ok.
30-01-70    3   Rolled over me. Nice but maybe not stand out. Needs more review.
31-01-70    3.5 Day after bust. Bass amp fails at start of 2nd set so only acoustic.
01-02-70    3   First famous guest (Peter Green) for a bust benefit. Nothing stand-out.
02-02-70    5   Only a fragment... but it's the perfect fragment!
04-02-70    4   Lots of energy, no big jams. Encore / filler with Santana / Airplane.
05-02-70    4   Setlists seem almost random now. Great Mason's. Nearly 4.5
06-02-70    4   Cracking little Other One. Such a big change from 8 months previous.
07-02-70    2.5 Lacking energy, inconsistent sound, no jams.
08-02-70    3   Mix of terrible aud and good sbd. Long long Lovelight. Star is butchered a bit.
11-02-70    4   Strange mix, although Star and jam both very good.
13-02-70    5   Greatest Dark Star ever? Greatest final set ever? Possibly my favourite show.
14-02-70    4.5 This is a long show. Epic, even. First set is probably the best.
23-02-70    2.5 Not exciting.
01-03-70    2.5 Messy tape, and nothing stands out. Super slow "It's all Over Now Baby Blue".
07-03-70    3   Rough audience. Hard to extract quality, but no seeming stand-out.
08-03-70    1.5 This show has the "mystery guest" who destroys the end of the show. Vince's first show!
20-03-70    3.5 Possible first Cutler introduction. Setlists are still chaotic. Pig asks for girl at end.
21-03-70a   4   Tolerable audience. Insane Viola Lee Blues - best ever?
21-03-70b   4   Opens with a killer Dancin', which had 90% of the jamming. High energy though.
24-03-70    4   Not a bad show, not erupting into highlights though.
03-04-70    3.5 Lacked a bit of punch, really.
09-04-70    3   2nd set sound quality dips to a very rough audience, hard to rate.
11-04-70    3   Really only the NFA > Lovelight at the end.
12-04-70    4   Another great Viola Lee to end the show.
15-04-70    4.5 Super fast intense jam out of Cryptical.
24-04-70    3.5 Recorded from the toilet? Eleven sounds good though.
01-05-70    3   Acoustic set stood out far more than the electric. Great sound quality.
02-05-70    4.5 Very good with killer Other One. Just lacking in space.
03-05-70    1   Truly dreadful audience, only for completionists. Also, no jams.
06-05-70    3   Campus strike for Kent state shootings. Nice sound, Dancin' was the highlight.
07-05-70    1.5 "Jerry Garcia looks like Phil Spectre". Boomy audience, and very long.
08-05-70    1   Another hissy, terrible aud - unlistenable. Sounds like a good jam at the start.
09-05-70    2   Worst soundboard ever? Part of an acoustic set.
14-05-70    3   Another hissy tape, but gets better. Didn't stand out though.
15-05-70a   3.5 A bit too relaxed but the jams were nice and the quality was definitly good.
15-05-70b   4   Pig says Bobby has a dirty mouth. Slighty more energy in the jams.
16-05-70    2   Another super rough audience, with added cuts. Nothing of excitement here.
24-05-70    4   First UK gig. Improvements in structure, jamming and sound quality.
04-06-70    2.5 Semi-decent audience, but literally no jams. Bit boring.
05-06-70    3   Finally a decent sbd. But also no big jams. Acoustic set might be the best part.
06-06-70    4   Had potential. Great Alligator jam but too short. Bobby sells the latest record.
07-06-70    3.5 First Main Ten jam and Sugar Magnolia (last is worst version ever). Very up and down.
13-06-70    3   Nice energy, no jams. Big jamming seems to have gone away. Long ass Lovelight.
21-06-70    2.5 Another pretty bad audience with no jamming. Nothing exciting.
24-06-70a   4   Specifically for the high energy Other One, even though it was short.   
24-06-70b   3.5 Not a great aud but high energy and a strange split Dark Star.
01-07-70    3   Only existing Canadian train ride audio. Too short, and slightly rough.
10-07-70    2   The tide of auds continues. This one is pretty bad. Band is also sloppy.
11-07-70    3.5 This aud is particularly bad. Acoustic set is not bad, and the electric set is better.
12-07-70    3   Another very rough aud. Mixed bag, Dancin' was probably the highlight.
14-07-70    4   Finally, not an aud! Best acoustic of 1970 so far. Lots of cuts in 2nd set though.
16-07-70    4.5 Janis Joplin sits in on Lovelight. What more do you need to know? Also a SBD.
30-07-70    3.5 Only the acoustic set, but in pretty good quality. 14/7 was better though.
05-08-70    3.5 Only an acoustic show. Good representation of what they were doing at the time.
17-08-70    2.5 This may be the wrong date. Snippets only. Again an aud. Hard to rate.
18-08-70    3.5 First Truckin' and Ripple. Back to auds again. Train wreck Sugar Mag.
19-08-70    3.5 Introduced as "The kodiac woodchuck motherfuckers". Similar to last night.
30-08-70    4   Cracking Easy Wind on this short TV show. Worth watching.
17-09-70    4.5 Dreadful sound quality. Jerry directs the PA crew. First Box Of Rain? Great Dark Star.
18-09-70    4.5 Best acoustic Truckin'. Show gets better and better; first set is mostly missing though.
19-09-70    5   Great gig and the 2nd best Star of the year so far. Also rare Darkness > China Cat jam.
20-09-70    5   Jerry on piano! Best acoustic set so far. Cutler intro again. Feedback jam!
04-10-70    3.5 Slight car crash on Casey Jones. Studio quadcast, so strange set list. Nice sound, no highlights.
10-10-70    3   Rough murky aud, and only 1 set. Hard to listen to, Other One > NFA sounded reasonable.
11-10-70    2   Hissy, muddy, warbly - what a dreadful aud! Seems like a good show though, just unlistenable.
17-10-70    4   Another dodgy audience. Quietest Star ever. Show would be great in better quality.
23-10-70    3.5 Reasonable aud tape for the time, but the jams are pretty short. "Been nice trippin' with you!".
24-10-70    3.5 It's a soundboard finally, but not great sq. First NFA > GDTRFB > NFA. No big or medium jams.
30-10-70    3   Jerry complains about having 2 shows. So-so, with no jams really; set-list deceives.
31-10-70a   3   Early show. A normal 1970 first set, although the acoustic stuff seems to have gone missing.
31-10-70b   4   Late show. Pig songs are great as are Hard To Handle and the Other One. A bit short though.
05-11-70    4.5 First show with Ned Lagin. Awesome set list. Terrible SQ. Possibly a 5 if the SQ was better.
07-11-70    2.5 Another dreadful aud. Long, with no major jamming except an early Truckin > Drums > Other One.
08-11-70    4.5 First Main Ten jam. Also has first Hard To Handle jam riff, minus the song. Good show.
09-11-70    3   Mix of aud sources, probably not this date. And in terrible aud cuts with no jams.
11-11-70    2   Jam with Hot Tuna at end. First La Bamba! Sound quality is bad, and then gets worse.
16-11-70    4.5 Awesome quality for 70, and with Steve Winwood! Sounds like a real fun show.
20-11-70    3   Another tape with a "super-jam" at the end, but it wasn't anything special for me.
21-11-70    4   Also listed as Ned's first show. Nice, but really too short. Nice late Cosmic Charlie.
29-11-70    3   Rough, far away type aud. Nothing of major interest here, except worst NFA start ever.

09-09-72    3.5 Nothing stands out.
10-09-72    4   Long and spacey.
15-09-72    3.5 Only about 30 minutes.
16-09-72    4   Hard to rate, only 1 hour, nice Dark Star.
17-09-72    3   Nothing stood out. Bad review?
21-09-72    4   Dreamy Dark Star.
23-09-72    4   Cryptical!
24-09-72    4.5 Horrible Playin' cut but very impressive.

17-10-72    3.5 Awesome Playin'. New PA? No big jams.
18-10-72    5   Perfect.
19-10-72    3.5
21-10-72    4.5 Incomplete, but solid fragments. Massive Phil.

26-10-72 
28-10-72    5   Awesome Star -> End!
12-11-72    3   Terrible mix. Hard to rate.
14-11-72    2.5 Competent. Nothing special..?
15-11-72    3.5 Great mix, no stand-outs.
17-11-72    4   Lost in second set...
18-11-72    4.5 Only second set, but great!
19-11-72    4.5 Needs more review.

24-11-72    3.5 Great end, nothing stand-out.
26-11-72    3.5 Terrible sound quality, maybe good?
10-12-72    4   Awesome Playin', great show. Last Pigpen mention!
11-12-72    4   Some horrible cuts but great.

09-02-73    4   Professional, new songs.
15-02-73    3.5 Watered down version of the previous show.
17-02-73    3.5 Good, nothing stood out except China > Rider.
19-02-73    4.5 Great second set.
21-02-73    4   High quality, no big jam.
22-02-73    4.5 Great PITB, very solid. Almost a great.
24-02-73    ?   Fragment of 10 minutes. Who knows?
26-02-73    4.5 Nice, relaxed, great sound.
28-02-73    4.5 Bad SQ, horrible cuts. Best Eyes so far.
15-03-73    4   Only 1/2 show, Playin end fucked up. Jam and OO was good.
16-03-73    4.5 Nearly perfect. Dreamy, laid back Star > Dew.
19-03-73    4   Another consistent 73 show. They moved Casey Jones!
21-03-73    5   Insect space Star. Best Step-Back. First Weather Report test.
22-03-73    4.5 Nearly 5! Star > Eyes, Star a little short.
24-03-73    4.5 SQ so-so. First China > Groovy jam. Has a Spanish jam.
26-03-73    5   Sick. Jams everywhere in set 2. Post Eyes! Weather Report!
28-03-73    4.5 Star > Eyes > PITB > JB Goode?!? Nearly 5.
30-03-73    4   Sloppy review, SQ not great.
31-03-73    4   Short but very sweet.
02-04-73    4   Very good. Needs a longer jam. Nearly 4.5
13-05-73    5   SQ mix is terrible. Show is awesome from Playin' onwards.
20-05-73    4.5 Sick semi-feedback jam before Eyes.
26-05-73    4.5 Kezar... enough said!
09-06-73    4.5 RFK... long jams, mellow, good.
10-06-73    4.5 Dew opener! Great Eyes. With Allmans, so-so.
22-06-73    5   Awesome Truckin' > Other One.
24-06-73    5   Phil 'er up! Great Star > Eyes.
26-06-73    4.5 SQ not good! Couldn't match recent shows.
29-06-72    4.5 Fantastic Other One > feedback. SQ not good.
30-06-73    4   Tough review. Star nice but short.
01-07-73    4.5 Insane OO, Great Playin'. Hard to say what is lacking.
27-07-73    4.5 Watkins Glen Jam. Strange.
28-07-73    3.5 Needs more review. All over the place.
01-08-73    4.5 El Paso ruins the fun! Star > El Paso > Eyes > Dew!
07-09-73    5   Step-Back awesome! Eyes of the year?
08-09-73    3   Nothing stood out.
11-09-73    4   First horns (only a little). Phil great in Dark Star.
12-09-73    2.5 Ugly horns. Nothing grabbed me.
15-09-73    2   Horns ruined Truckin'. Only 2nd set. Horns ruin most songs.
17-09-73    2   Jerry sings start of Sugar Mag! Damn horns.
20-09-73    2   Dodgy SQ. Bloody horns!
21-09-73    3.5 Much less horns. Needs more review.
24-09-73    3.5 Horns kill big jams. But mixed better here.
26-09-73    4   Best horns is least horns!
19-10-73    5   Star > MLB > Dew. Eyes > Stella encore!
21-10-73    5   Playin' and set 2 of awesome.
23-10-73    5   Sublime set 2. Fight stops encore!
25-10-73    5   Another crazy second set!
29-10-73    4   Good. Eyes in first set? Strange set-list
30-10-73    4.5 No complaints. Needs more review..
01-11-73    5   Partial. Great jamming.
09-11-73    4   Needs more review. A few cuts.
11-11-73    4.5 Great end to DS. Awesome encore.
14-11-73    4   Solid...but not as good as others.
17-11-73    4   Song selection solid...just needs more.
20-11-73    3.5 Other One started great! But no highlights.
21-11-73    3.5 Good but not as good as others.
25-11-73    4   Bid you goodnight! Needs more space.
30-11-73    4.5 SQ is great. Hints of greatness. Needs more jams!
01-12-73    4.5 Long Step-Back, great Playin' > UJB jam.
02-12-73    5   Intense Playin' > MLB, super mellow after. Encore is Dew!
04-12-73    4.5 Fantastic meltdown after Eyes.
06-12-73    4.5 45 minute Star was a little unexpected!
08-12-73    5   Severe OO meltdown into proto Seastones.
12-12-73    4   Very nice (like most of '73), but no major jams.
18-12-73    5   Ain't nobody who does what the Dead do!
19-12-73    4   Needs more review.

22-02-74    4   Very well played but nothing stand-out.
23-02-74    4.5 No obvious stand-outs but still very good.
24-02-74    5   Dark Star > Dew!
23-03-74    4.5 Another crazy Playing > UJB > Dew > UJB > Playin'!
12-05-74    4   Partial show from Truckin'. Nice Truckin' meltdown.
14-05-74    5   Let It Grow > Dark Star. Crisp sound, great jam. Pure Dead.
17-05-74    4.5 Needs more review, but still, what a show.
19-05-74    4   Can't remember anything bad, but no major stand-outs.
21-05-74    4.5 Although the 45-minute Playin' deserves a 5.
25-05-74    3.5 No big jam, excellent otherwise.
08-06-74    5   Awesome PITB - best so far?
16-06-74    5   Another mental PITB, and that's just the 1st set.
18-06-74    5   Pretty mental, best Let It Grow so far. Nearly 4.5.
20-06-74    5   These shows are crazy. WRS great, Eyes jam with Slipknot.
22-06-74    4.5 Tough call. The Playin' is fantastic. Eyes almost goes Seastones.
23-06-74    4   Nice Spanish jam, but a bit short on jamming.
26-06-74
28-06-74    5   Best WRS ever, with MLB and Star jams.
30-06-74    4   Maybe should be 4.5, Playin' is good, jam double-dips.
19-07-74    4.5 Loving me these Spanish jams.
21-07-74
25-07-74    4.5 Short show, but nice Star.
27-07-74    2.5 No jam in 2nd set, although US Blues tried to start one.
29-07-74    3.5 Better, small Spanish jam but no real big jams.
31-07-74    4.5 Best Truckin' jam I ever heard, almost a 5.
04-08-74    5   Great Playin' and really good 2nd set.
05-08-74    5   Now THIS is what a Truckin' jam should be like!
06-08-74    5   Greatest first set so far, and Spanish Jam > Other One in 2nd
09-09-74    4.5 Tough. Short show, nearly a 5. Cut up a bit too much.
10-09-74    5   Awesome Star > Dew. Best Dew so far?
11-09-74    5   Most epic Seastones > Eyes combo.
14-09-74    4   Some fluffs mixed with nice jamming.
18-09-74    3.5 Nice - but lacks big jams.
20-09-74    4   As above, really - Needs more review.
21-09-74    4.5 Slightly unusual set-list, majestic 17 minute Dew.
16-10-74    5   This show has everything.
17-10-74    4.5 Nice recording, not as good as last night.
18-10-74    4.5 Seastones > Star! Although end of set 2 is anti-climatic.
19-10-74    3.5 Didn't really stand out. Truckin' start was weird as hell though.
20-10-74    3.5 All of these shows are a bit strange, really. Nothing stand-out.

23-03-75    5   Up there with the best shows ever. Totally unique.
17-06-75    4   Nice, slightly strange setlist, as you'd expect.
13-08-75
28-09-75    3.5 Another "nice" show, lacking in any out-there jamming.

03-06-76    2.5 Too slow and laid-back; lacks any spark or major jamming.
04-06-76    3   Weak PITB, seems very tame. Gets slightly better near the end.
09-06-76    3   Slightly better. The pace of these shows is a little uneven.
10-06-76    3.5 PITB had a reasonable jam. Band is really different though.
11-06-76    3   These shows have jamming, but it doesn't really grab you.
12-06-76    3.5 I'm not registering these shows much. Band was tighter.
14-06-76    4   Shows are getting better, but scary space has left.
15-06-76    3.5 Slightly hard to rate these, but they seem to be getting better.
17-06-76    3.5 These shows all sound similar. All the jams are contained.
18-06-76    3.5 Lacks energy until the end of second set.
19-06-76    3   Didn't stick out at all. Strange set list again.
21-06-76    3.5 The set lists seem very similar, as does the vibe.
22-06-76    4   FOTM jam in Playin' led by Phil. Laid back with seemingly 2 mini second sets.
23-06-76    3.5 "Garcia has the biggest beard!". Long gaps between songs. 2nd set too slow.
24-06-76    4   Pretty upbeat for June 76. Great quality 2nd set. Short but not shabby at all.
26-06-76    3.5 Same as almost all the other June 76 shows....
27-06-76    3.5 Thin Jerry sound in 1976. Like others of this time, lacks bite and energy, even if well played.
28-06-76    4.5 Eyes 6 minute intro, and bass solo at end. Only 'Happiness Is Drumming'. Solid throughout.
29-06-76    4   Slightly better. Not a bad jam in Playin'.
12-07-76    3   Didn't grab me. A lot of songs have the same speed.
13-07-76    4   Some space, and some improvements.
14-07-76    4   Things are looking up at last. Not a bad show.
16-07-76    4   Second set only; format seemed more usual. Not bad!
17-07-76    3   Needs more review, but didn't grab me in any way.
18-07-76    3   Nothing outstanding...par for the period, it seems.
02-08-76    3.5 My first audience... Playin' was ok, more usual second set.
04-08-76    2.5 It rolls, but doesn't rock.
23-09-76    3.5 Awful sound quality, show wasn't too bad though.
24-09-76        DAVES PICKS 4
25-09-76        DICKS PICKS 20
27-09-76    3.5 Not a fan of the long Franklin's in this era, but not bad.
28-09-76    4   Nice first set, and second set not too shabby either.
30-09-76    3   Needs more review, but didn't grab me particularly
01-10-76    4   Good show, just needs some more energy. Great jam in Slipknot, maybe best yet.
02-10-76    3.5 Rough aud. Whole show seems to have an octave pedal  for the vocals. Nice Dancin' though.
03-10-76    3.5 Only set 2. Little China cat jam in there. Good, not stellar.
09-10-76    4   Hey...not bad! Good feeling of energy, the first for a while.
10-10-76    4.5 I'd venture to say that was actually a good show!
14-10-76    3.5 Only set 2. Not as good as previous night but good energy.
15-10-76    4   Keeps the energy. Not bad, but only just a 4
31-12-76    4.5 Best show of the year, but still not quite a 5!

26-02-77    5   Awesome first set. Just a great show really.
27-02-77    3.5 Still has vestiges of 1976 - slow and lacking in energy. Terrapin is strictly by the numbers.
18-03-77    4   Low energy or very laid back? Only Terrapin flyer. From the sublime to the ridiculous at the end.
19-03-77    4   Pretty good. Different feel straight away with 1977.
20-03-77    4   These seem to have more structure and energy than 1976.
22-04-77    4   Weird... better but similar, these shows.
23-04-77    4.5 Rocking and good.
25-04-77    4.5 Terrible SQ quality, jam in second set is great.
26-04-77    3   Pretty bad aud - sounds like a bar band. Show itself seemed fixed in one gear. Nothing great.
27-04-77    3.5 Bad sound, and not as good as 2 nights ago.
29-04-77    4   Strange set-list pre-drums. Great HSF to start. Sound quality so-so. Interestring, not amazing.
30-04-77    4   Good show, high energy but few jams.
01-05-77    3.5 Only 2nd set, didn't inspire me.
03-05-77    3.5 Didn't flow so well in the 2nd set, a very stop start effort. Moore's aud is good though.
04-05-77    4   Jerry out of tune at start. Get this for the dreamy Playin' jam at the end of the 2nd set.
05-05-77    4   Rocking end, jams are contained in the songs and not between.
07-05-77    4   Another good 1977 show with little jamming.
08-05-77    4.5 It is as smooth as butter, as they say.
09-05-77    4   Almost 4.5, very smooth as well.
11-05-77    3.5 Shows are hard to review. All the space jamming has gone.
12-05-77    3.5 Aud runs fast at end of 2nd set. Pretty mellow throughout. Standard for the period, I'd say.
13-05-77    4   Good Other One and a rocking end to the show
15-05-77    4   Nice 1st set. Bit slow in middle of 2nd set.
17-05-77    4   More songs, less variation. Sets are good though.
18-05-77    4   Seems 4 is a bit common. I enjoyed the show though.
19-05-77    4   Nothing wrong with this show, other than a slight lack of pace. Ending suite is really good.
21-05-77    4.5 Very slick show. Not a bad number throughout. Just lacks a bit of space at the end.
22-05-77    4.5 Terrapin missing first section, pretty unique but doesn't work for me. Awesome Morning Dew at end.
25-05-77    4   Another 4? The setlists are become a bit more modern.
26-05-77    4.5 Nearly a 4, but better than others around this time.
28-05-77    4   Back to the standard 1977! Setlists are becoming modern.
04-06-77    4   Fantastic setlist for the 2nd set; which was good, but felt like a greatest hits collection.
07-06-77    3.5 Had a great Dew but the rest didn't shine for me, despite what seems like a great set-list.
08-06-77    5   What a nice, tasty 77 show. Jam before NFA is great.
09-06-77    4.5 Is everything just exactly perfect? Just ask Bob. Awesome Help>Slip. Maybe it nearly is. Good show.
03-09-77    4.5 Infamous Raceway Park gig. Good on a lot of levels. Most songs are excellent. What a NFA as well!
28-09-77    3.5 Maybe it just didn't stack up against the last couple of shows.
29-09-77    3.5 Also not so inspiring.
01-10-77    3   What can you do if nothing inspires? Nothing stand-out.
02-10-77    3.5 Nothing wrong, nothing right.
06-10-77        TODO: This show on archive is not correct.
07-10-77    4   Only has partial show (about 90 mins). Still a pretty cracking set list and has plenty of energy.
09-10-77    4.5 First real drums, great Sugaree and Truckin'
11-10-77
12-10-77    3.5 Like real second sets! Some lazy song choices.
14-10-77    4.5 Really helped by the 18 minute Playing, best since '74.
15-10-77    4   Nice Estimated > Drums > Other One. Out of tune US Blues.
16-10-77
28-10-77    3.5 Nice energy, main jam was He's Gone... not a fan.
29-10-77    4.5 Best Let It Grow since '74. Space in second set!
30-10-77
01-11-77    4   Rocking end, but quite a short show. Truckin' was the highlight.
02-11-77
04-11-77    3.5 Not as good as recent ones. Needs more review?
05-11-77
06-11-77    4   Killer Truckin' is the stand-out.
27-12-77    3.5 Nice energy, didn't catch much. Rocking at the end.
29-12-77
30-12-77    4   Some nice playing, but very very short.
31-12-77    4   Standard for the year. These shows are quite short.

06-01-78    4   Phil breaks a string. Jerry's voice pretty bad. All Bob songs in 2nd set. Fiery end.
07-01-78    4   No Jerry songs at all.  Long Dancin' meanders a bit then opens up. Tough to rate.
08-01-78    3.5 Tiny 'Close Encounters' riff at start of 2nd set. Phil sings on Good Lovin'. Uncle Bobo present.
10-01-78    3.5 Weak voice from Jerry. Also set choice wasn't that great for me on this one. Nice MOTB though.
11-01-78    4.5 Plenty of rocking energy, and the Playing was very good.
13-01-78    4   Close Encounters themes all over this month. Space section after drums. Nasty cut at end.
14-01-78    4.5 Hissy SBD. But has a great tiger almost into feedback territory.
15-01-78    4.5 Best Playin' since 1974? Great last 50 minutes. Only AUD for 2nd set though.
17-01-78    4   Nothing really stand-out; Space and Estimated save it.
18-01-78    4   Another good Playing. Tape is not the best quality. Blackbird riff at start of encore.
22-01-78    5   Cooking second set, even hotter after the close encounters jam. Best solo Jerry.
30-01-78    3.5 Didn't stick out, although full of energy at the end.
31-01-78    4   Good, don't know whether they are starting to sound a bit samey though. Another space.
02-02-78    4   A little short, it seems, but filled with quality.
03-02-78
04-02-78
05-02-78
06-04-78    3.5 Nothing too shabby, nothing too special. Bad PA static in last 2 songs does not help.
07-04-78    3.5 Again, it rolled over a bit like the last show. Nothing really bad though.
08-04-78    4   Slightly better. But these shows are starting to sound very familiar. More close encounters.
10-04-78    3   A unique (?) terrible joke. Otherwise largely uninspired.
11-04-78    3   Bit better. First Iko Iko, but a long-ass drums and not much jamming.
12-04-78    3.5 Jerry painfully out of tune in BIODTL. 26 minutes of drums! Bad cut at end of 2nd set.
14-04-78    3.5 Second time Jerry out of tune, at start of 2nd set. Nice but nothing special.
15-04-78    4.5 Best first set start ever with Half Step > Passenger? Good Playing, only Dew of 1978. Nearly 5.
16-04-78    3.5 Drums and space is becoming formalised. Continues the 78 standard of 3.5
18-04-78    3   Tape is all over the place, especially in Passenger. Another Blackbird tease. Pedestrian.
19-04-78    3   Again a bit too pedestrian. Post drums and first Werewolf make up for it a little.
21-04-78    4   Best drums and space of the year so far. A step up from recent shows.
22-04-78    3.5 Dicks Picks 15. These shows can be more miss than hit.
24-04-78    4   Monkey drums and space is probably the best so far. The rest of the set is similar to early 78 stuff.
05-05-78    3   Phil out of tune in NFA? He plays some bum notes at the end of Werewolves. Slightly boring.
06-05-78    4   Awesome LLR and Deal in first set. Teddy Bears picnic riff before Terrapin. Better than average for 78.
07-05-78    4   Nothing in particular stood apart from the great MNS, but overall not a bad show at all.
09-05-78    4   Pretty bad AUD, but still a nice show. Spaces are getting interesting. "USA" chant before the encore.
10-05-78    4   Rough aud (this and the last show are DP 25). Like 77, sometimes the 4's come in batches.
11-05-78    3.5 Lots of laughs in Dancin'. Drums a little long. Nice Stella Blue. Weir solo in Werewolves. Double encore.
13-05-78    4   Another quite nice show. Quite a while since a really decent show though.
15-05-78    4   Tough. Hate to keep giving these 4, but that's what it is. Nice UJB encore made a change.
16-05-78    3.5 You can hear Weir on the audience tape. More solo Jerry in space. Slow second set.
17-05-78    3.5 Great Space > Terrapin choice near the end couldn't raise the profile of this.
04-06-78    3   Space has some terrible Donna squealing, and motorbikes. Band sound drunk or high. Manic ending.
25-06-78    4.5 Stunning (for 1978) feedback jam and chaos after drums. Solid show.
01-07-78    4   Wille Nelson 4th July picnic. Unusual show with 1 long set, but still pretty good.
03-07-78    4   Phil: "Whoever is throwing firecrackers belongs in the Ted Nugent concert". Awful slide in Werewolves.
05-07-78    3.5 Estimated almost went somewhere. Space was good, but the rest of the show lacked any major spark.
07-07-78    4   Very short second set (1h 5m or similar). Unusual 'Nobodies fault' jam in NFA. Not bad.
08-07-78    4.5 Tiny tiny hint of Star out of space? Good show. Killer encore, and laid back throughout most.
30-08-78    4   First "Miracle". Only 2nd set. Screwed up BEW. Phil scat sings in space. Excellent IIHTWTG.
31-08-78    3.5 Nasty SBD cut in Terrapin. First "Shakedown" - not bad. Weak end to Sugar Mag.
02-09-78    4   Good jam pre-drums, only 1 song after space which is an out-of-tune Sugar Mag.
14-09-78    3   First Eygpt show. It's pretty messy, with the starting jam and space being the best.
15-09-78    3   Jerry talks offhand - first time for a long long time. Better than first night, but still not great.
16-09-78    4   You can hear Jerry call a song. Shakedown has best jam of Eygpt. Excellent drums > space.
17-10-78    4   Jerry asked for banjo lessons in space. Wonderful IIHTWTG, and a show with nice structure.
18-10-78    4   Nice Good Lovin'. Shows have picked up since Eygpt. Good, but not ground-breaking.
20-10-78    3.5 Dancin' outro jam was the best; nothing else really popped out.
21-10-78    4   Nice show, but it's hard to reach those 4.5 scores now. Still, Lee Oskar was good.
22-10-78    4   Nice NFA jam, the whole show was 'nice' but didn't go crazy anywhere. Still, has a Caution jam...
11-11-78    3   Nice video, short but sweet. Quality is pretty nice. Of course it has zero jamming.
13-11-78    4.5 PITB > Drums > Space > Black Peter > Playin' had an almost dreamy quality to it.
14-11-78    3.5 Not terrible, not special. One of those that sails past you without offending.
16-11-78    4   Worst audience for a while. Band weird from drums onward. Best Truckin' of 78? Nearly 4.5.
17-11-78a   4   Early acoustic. What a strange gig. Not musically exiting but a real change.
17-11-78b   3.5 Terrible audience tape that has cuts. Hard to rate, seems to have good energy.
18-11-78    4.5 At last a decent soundboard. Monster He's Gone > Other One. Best Other One since 1974.
20-11-78    4.5 Bobby was sick, misses a lot of the show. Cuts aplenty. Craziest set opener since the 60's?
21-11-78    4   Props to the clever woman in the audience. Great Truckin', pity about the sound quality.
23-11-78    3.5 Show is a soundboard but it's very choppy and cut up. Best is the Eygpt space > Shakedown. Nearly 4.
24-11-78    4.5 Great show with perhaps the ultimate 78 Shakedown. Avaliable on video as well.
12-12-78    4.5 This is a very smooth show that I enjoyed, it was very relaxed and reminded me of 74 second set ends.
13-12-78    4   Lovely Playin' in this one. Late 78 is definitly a step up from the summer.
15-12-78    3.5 Good energy at the end but it overall this show didn't stand out.
16-12-78    4   Says aud but sounds like Matrix! Overall nice energy and long songs. But not cutting enough.
17-12-78    3.5 The auds keep coming. Last Egypt jam? Out of tune Sugar Mag, long drums.
19-12-78    3.5 Another aud. Stella > NFA is the smoothest transition ever. Good on paper kind of show.
21-12-78    3   Dreadful aud. Boomy, and at the back of the hall. Black Peter may have been good.
22-12-78    3   Another dreadful aud! Cut at the end to. Didn't sound musically worse, but the sound was dreadful.
27-12-78    3.5 Yet another aud, better but more crowd noise. Nothing stood out at particularly good or bad.
28-12-78    4   Finally a crisp board. Lovelight riff at end of Eyes. Jerry tells Keith to be quiet. Killer Sugar Mag.
30-12-78    4   Great first set. Good Hamza. St. Stephen with Mu-Tron is awesome for first 5 seconds.
31-12-78    4.5 This show has everything in 3 sets. Best part is post-Star in the 3rd set.

05-01-79    3.5 Starts as a high-energy aud. Lots of cuts. Nobodys Fault jam was the highlight.
07-01-79    3.5 First show at MSG. PA craps out near end of 2nd set. Nothing too special.
08-01-79    4   Another aud, quite a lot in this period. Jerry's voice is shot. 2nd set like a 77 show.
10-01-79    4.5 First East coast Dark star for a while. Good show; Star better than 31-12-78.
11-01-79    4   Maybe all auds on this tour. End of second set post drums is where the action is.   
12-01-79    4   Continuing the auds. Has a super-long Dancin' but it didn't grab as much as it could.
14-01-79    3   Worst aud of the tour so far. Bobby high in the mix. The 2nd set is a little rushed.
15-01-79    4.5 Fantastic aud, and a great second set Terrapin > Playing make this worth a listen.
17-01-79    4   Another stunning aud. Bit of an epic as well, long 2nd set. Jerry has a weak voice near end.
18-01-79    3.5 No drums for a change, but I didn't get much from this show.
20-01-79    4   Another Dark Star, but pretty short. Could have been better. Moore's aud is great.
21-01-79    3   Dreadful aud, boomy with no top. Hard to tell, but didn't sound special.
03-02-79    4   First set sbd, 2nd set aud. Nice overall show with good energy.
04-02-79    4   It was another decent show. Jerry has a certain "super fast licks mode" which is getting more common.
07-02-79    3.5 Jerry hits 4 valiums. Recording is incomplete and in the wrong order. Sluggish.
09-02-79    5   Dodgy aud with a lot of hiss. Long He's Gone leads to sublime jam > drums > space. Shakedown encore!
10-02-79    4.5 Noisy aud again. Eyes has got pretty fast recently. We're hotting up on this tour!
17-02-79    4   K+D's last show. Messy in parts (Bertha / Shakedown), but some jamming was on point.
22-04-79    4   Brent's first show. Different sound straight away. Space is great.
03-05-79    3.5 Some strange PA issues in Black Peter. Nice Playin', but pretty normal even with Brent's new sounds.
05-05-79    3.5 "Good morning Philip" says Bob in the opener. Obvious new toys in space + drums. Punchy encore.
07-05-79    3.5 Not a good Brent patch for Estimated. Great NFA with Cippollina. Slightly plodding until the end.
09-05-79    4   Phil wears a Pigpen t-shirt. Great Masterpiece tease/jam. 2nd set much better than the first.
11-05-79    3.5 Another super-speedy Eyes. Brent + Drums section is very jazzy. No encore spoils the end a little.
12-05-79    3.5 Aud is very 'windy'. Terrapin' > Playin is where the heat is, although nothing surprising.
13-05-79    3   Another aud, quite a lot for this period it seems. No obvious highlights, sq is bad though.
28-06-79    3   Only the 2nd set, and not a great sbd. Some nasty cuts kill the flow.
30-06-79    3   Another pedestrian show. Aud conversation about Brent was probably the best part.
01-07-79    3.5 Great quality in comparison to recent shows, not sure it was a significantly better show though.
04-08-79    4.5 First appearence of Tiger, Althea and Lost Sailor. Good first set. Great Playin', awesome Stella Blue.
05-08-79    3.5 Not as good as the previous night and a few too many cuts to songs. Triple encore though.
12-08-79    4   2nd year at Red Rocks. Best Eyes jam for a long time, cracking drums. SBD runs fast though.
13-08-79    3   Can't say anything stood out at this show. End Truckin' was probably the highlight.
14-08-79    3.5 First Brent song. I swear Jerry sings "drink your wealth" in the last 2 US Blues.
31-08-79    3.5 New songs a bit botched. "Can we play something easier?". Eyes is too fast again.
01-09-79    3.5 Really good space - best for a while. Second set was too short - Scarlet > Fire > Drums??
02-09-79    4.5 Set list is killer. Awesome return for Let It Grow. Another good Stella Blue.
04-09-79    3.5 Lots of comebacks recently - China Rider this show. He's Gone very jammy. Too many songs have mistakes.
05-09-79    3.5 Hotting up on the Half-Step > Franklins openers. Nice Estimated, Eyes again too fast. End was lame.
06-09-79    4   Mind Left Body hint after NFA! Better than the previous 2 nights and good from Terrapin onwards.
24-10-79    5   Already tired of "Easy To Love You". Good "Fire". Short but sweet Playin'. Short killer 2nd set.
25-10-79    4.5 What a Shakedown! Crazy space with fairly mental bass. Not quite as killer as the previous night though.
27-10-79    4   Some jamming length epics, but the fire was sparked less frequently than the last 2 shows.
28-10-79    3.5 Jeez those long Franklins go nowhere. Nice China Rider and Playing though.
31-10-79    4   China > Rider opener. Jerry speaks about crowd crush. Good Shakedown 2nd set opener. Ends well.
01-11-79    4.5 38 mins of Scarlet Fire: most jammed version? Space was good; some potential was missed though.
02-11-79    4   Lots of stage talk in jam pre drums. Another 20+ minute Franklins. Good, but greatness eludes.
04-11-79    3   First Alabama Getaway. He's Gone is best part of pedestrian show. Horrible cut at end as well.
05-11-79    3.5 Rare China Rider opener. Sailor > Saint out of drums. Long songs doesn't always mean more jamming.
06-11-79    4   Quality first set. Good set list in 2nd set, helped by 20 min Playing, Still, that 1st set...
08-11-79    4   Only Morning Dew of 1979 tipped this one over to 4. Lots of talking in drums/space. Short 2nd set.
09-11-79    4   Smoking Alabama > Promised opener. End of Dancin' pretty smooth. Gloria jam in He's Gone.
10-11-79    3.5 First CR+S for a while, Sound mix a bit all over the place, but the second set was fairly good.
23-11-79    4   Rare High Time. Great Music > Sugaree to start set 2. A bit up, a bit down, but more up than down.
24-11-79    3.5 Jerry solos over a strange part of Ship Of Fools. A little lacking in energy.
25-11-79    4.5 Some space in pre-drums jam, excellent Stella Blue. Possible Jerry is drunk or high? A litle strange.
29-11-79    3.5 Great SBD. Rare High Time. Sloppy end to 2nd set, but at least the Eyes jam was decent.
30-11-79    4   Good Alabama opener and solid Dancin' in 1st set. Nothing stellar, but not a bad show.
01-12-79    4   Slightly bizarre jam out of He's Gone - quite unusual. Lacks energy, but makes a change.
03-12-79    3   Shows have become a bit more predictable, but the first sets have got better. Nothing new here.
04-12-79    4   First interesting jam out of Franklins. Great Stella Blue (as always, it seems). Not bad.
05-12-79    4.5 2hr 5 mins for the 2nd set! Crazy Other One. Scat singing in Black Peter. 5 uptempo songs to end!
07-12-79    4   Terrific fanning on MNS. Beautiful space pre-drums. Has some good touches, but doesn't sustain them.
09-12-79    4   7 shows pre drums in 2nd set! Weird Playin' jam out of Saint. Very up and down, but above average.
10-12-79    3.5 First aud in a long time. Easy To Love You sucks again. Explosive Truckin'. Very up and down.
11-12-79    3.5 Get the Matrix! Unusual Estimated jam with no estimated. Alabama encore, but 2nd set seemed rushed.
26-12-79    4   15 minute Shakedown > UJB opener? Mixed, but harder to say what is bad than what is good.
27-12-79    3   2nd set back to the auds. Double encore is nice, but SQ makes it hard to love the 2nd set.
28-12-79    4   Best Playin' for a long time. Whistling jam in drums. Good ending but bad song selection.
30-12-79    3.5 Pretty short show, most noticable for being so short! Best part was the Let It Grow jam.
31-12-79    3.5 Space before midnight countdown; 3 sets, all strange. Uncle John's meltdown is good. Bobby has a cold.

13-01-80    4   Single set show. Santana and Cippolina for end of set jam. Jerry sings "Shah of Iran" in US Blues.
30-03-80    3.5 Encore with John Belushi. First Far From Me. Train wreck Saint Of Circumstance.
31-03-80    4   Some songs missing. First Stranger. Quite a fun audience. Great set list.
01-04-80    4   With April Fools Promised Land. Great Stranger and China Rider to start 2nd set.
28-04-80    4   Setlists are a bit similar recently. Still, great start, Black Peter was good and high energy.
29-04-80    4   Fantastic aud. Long Terrapin jam; Miracle > Bertha > Good Lovin set 2 ends suck a little though.
01-05-80    3.5 Really weird Estimated > UJB change. Short Drums > Space. 2nd set a little rushed and short.
02-05-80    3.5 Another Miracle > Bertha > Good Lovin' 2nd set end. Raging energy, no jams. 1st better than 2nd.
04-05-80    4   Good setlist, with nice little Playing jam. 1980 seems repetitive but this is just about a 4.
06-05-80    3.5 Stranger is either jammed or a train wreck. Needed more of something.
07-05-80    4.5 "Playing in the Barn"; another well constructed show in Barton Hall, almost 3 years to the day.
08-05-80    4.5 Best Eyes pace for a long while. Decent 'modern' UJB. Drums > Space very on point.
10-05-80    3   Messy in places (Stranger, Estimated). Energy is right up there though. 7 songs pre drums.
11-05-80    3   Stranger > Terrapin, nice idea on paper but not on stage. Around is worse now attached to JB Goode.
12-05-80    4.5 Raging opener. 1st sets can now be fast and furious. Excellent He's Gone jam. Very solid.
14-05-80    3.5 Easy To Love You goes wrong. Short but very sweet space. 1980 seems inconsistently consistent.
15-05-80    3   Nice set list but nothing really that attracted my attention. Again, 1st set mayber better.
16-05-80    3   Even a rare Morning Dew couldn't do much to raise my interest in this show. 
29-05-80    2.5 Not a great source - boomy and cut up. Not that enjoyable on many levels.
30-05-80    3.5 Professional, but even the Playin' jam didn't go anywhere at all. As normal as it gets.
31-05-80    3.5 Alabama followed by Alambama again! High energy at the end but lacking exploration.
05-06-80    4   Surprisingly mellow Terrapin Jam into a decent space. Rest was typical 1980's stuff though.
07-06-80    4   Passenger! (although not a great version). Had some fun elements. Decent 'Saint of Circumstance'.
08-06-80    3.5 UJB > Playin' to open the 1st set! And a cool Eyes jam. All around is average though.
12-06-80    3.5 Set 2 starts with drums. Some jamming was on point, but overall it lacked a little spark.
13-06-80    4   Passenger has no energy. This space has feedback! Jerry out of tune in Alabama.
14-06-80    3   Anonymous first set. Second set wasn't much better, although Stella Blue was good.
19-06-80    3.5 Rare 2nd set Peggy-O. Good show but fails to spark, like a lot of 1980. First Alaska show.
20-06-80    3.5 Pre-drums was great. Duck whistle jam in drums. Around & Around's new arrangement still sucks.
21-06-80    4.5 Despite not hearing this show for 25 years, I still remember parts. Best show of the year?
29-06-80    4   Enjoyed this one, even though it lacked in jams (the normal complaint for this period).
01-07-80    3.5 Possibly the quietest SBD I've ever heard. Overall not so bad. Repetitive set formats though.
16-08-80    3.5 Outdoor festival show. Very easy for these shows to pass over with nothing standing out.
17-08-80    2.5 Lazy Fire jam into drums, and short pre-drums. Lack of excitment post drums, even with a Wheel.
19-08-80    4   Slighty messy Eyes into awesome post-Eyes jam. Nice unusual set list. Playin' reprise!
20-08-80    3.5 Last 2 shows feeling a bit different in the setlists. This still lacks major jamming though.
21-08-80    3.5 Last night of three. 2nd set starts with drums>space. Nothing stunning but another strange setlist.
23-08-80    3   Another back to back Alabama. Shitty aud. Didn't stand out, then again the quality was terrible.
24-08-80    3   Stranger > China > Rider > Drums ?! Bit of a novelty factor re set list, but nothing new here.
26-08-80    3   Mixed up setlists are continuing, but can't make up for the lack of excitement here.
27-08-80    3.5 Good Althea, and they finally got the end to Stranger. Speedy Eyes again. Not so bad.
28-08-80    3.5 Lovely first Bird Song for a few years. Nice jam out of Terrapin. But no other obvious highlights.
29-08-80    3.5 Nice sound quality and enjoyable, but too non-descript. Strange setlists again.
30-08-80    4.5 Finally they start a show with Stranger! Nice 1st set. Best LLR? Cracking 2nd set with high energy.
31-08-80    4   Solid first set. Excellent Comes A Time. Fan rips out Jerry's cables in the encore, causing a Bobby solo.
02-09-80    4   Another Dew - can't complain. Shows have picked up a bit and the setlists are getting better.
03-09-80    3.5 Felt a little phoned in by halfway through the 2nd set. He's Gone out of drums though.
04-09-80    3.5 First mention of Brent on stage in tuning. Strange Supplication jam in 2nd set. Eyes too fast.
06-09-80    3   A LOT of songs in the setlist. Very long show, interesting setlist, but nothing really shines.
25-09-80    4   Acoustic first set. Jerry: "We figured wtf, might as well try". First set makes this a good one.
26-09-80    3.5 Great acoustic set followed by 2 very normal sets, which is similar to the previous night.
27-09-80    4   Bad sound quality. He's Gone > Other One leads to meltdown. Key change in Miracle?
29-09-80    3.5 Heaven Help The Fool in acoustic set. Good Terrapin > Drums > Space, but quality is so-so.
30-09-80    3   Tape sounds quite quiet. Very similar to last few nights. Super slow He's Gone.
02-10-80    4   Band argument after 'To Lay Me Down'. Jerry asks crowd to sing along! 2nd set starts with drums. Mellow.
03-10-80    3   Normal acoustic set. Tiger sounds very bright. Decent Playin'. Not really a good aud.
04-10-80    3.5 Jerry is loving these acoustic sets. Nice 'Let It Grow'. Miracle has the key change again. Long show.
06-10-80    3   Train wreck Terrapin "counting stars...". Not good if all you remember is the major error.
07-10-80    3   Sources are messy on this one. First Shakedown for ages. Again: acoustic set was the best.
09-10-80    4   Mellow, but good for it. Also, this was the first decent sbd of the whole run. Worth a listen.
10-10-80    4   Excellent acoustic set. Real long show. Rare promised land end of set. Sound issues near the end.
11-10-80    3.5 Funky Stranger. The final 2 sets are sucked of energy, even though again the first set was great.
13-10-80    4   Brent is great on piano here. 11th gen SBD! Cool little jam into Samson. Decent post-drums jam.
14-10-80    4   "Hey Jerry, did you like the 8-ball?". Great end to 1st set. Bass solo??? Long show.
18-10-80    3   Breezed past without being particularly noteworthy. Nothing bad, but also nothing that great.
19-10-80    3.5 Jerry said these 2 New Orleans shows were the best of the acoustic run. He's wrong about that.
22-10-80    3   Very quiet aud recording. Everybody sings in set one. Not very exciting, even with audience comments.
23-10-80    4   Good version of the Wheel. Cracking end of second set really. The audience tape was awesome.
25-10-80    3.5 Very loud, energetic crowd even clap along to Black Peter! Octave doubling artifact throughout on vocals.
26-10-80    4   Lovely soundboard. Slow Althea. Whole second set is slow. Bobby adding lots to the Good Loving end.
27-10-80    3   Short 3rd set. Sounds like Jerry is phoning it in. Bad ending of 4 rockers. First set was best.
29-10-80    3.5 Nice but not nice enough. Even the acoustic sets are strating to grate, despite some great banter.
30-10-80    4   Drums with Billy Cobham. Nice little He's Gone minor meltdown. Drums in Drums > Other One are great.
31-10-80    4   Really good acoustic set, maybe the best. Killer space. Rest is a lot more normal.
26-11-80    3.5 Back to 2 sets. Satisfaction encore. Bass solo out of space, but it didn't really lead anywhere.
28-11-80    4   Less Go To Heaven material is better. Nice Let It Grow > Terrapin jam, mainly mellow throughout.
29-11-80    3.5 Live at Alligator Alley. Amazing aud tape. Ridiculous Stella Blue key change. Nice set list.
30-11-80    4   Cooking Deal. Best Playin' for quite a while. End of set 2 has a nice China Doll but lacks energy.
06-12-80    4   Strange single set acoustic for charity. Like the other 1980 acoustic sets but more talking.
12-12-80    3.5 He's Gone for John Lennon. Supposedly Jerry was in tears, but it didn't really move me.
13-12-80    4.5 Nice solid show. Great Scarlet, Playing jam was long for 1980 and Black Peter was good also.
14-12-80    4   Like last night, stand-out space and drums. But the overall show was better last night.
26-12-80    4   Great Cassidy, despite being short. Spanish jam hints. Longish Playing as well.
27-12-80    3.5 Very good Eyes. Shows seem a lot stronger than the summer. SQ very good. Mellow throughout.
28-12-80    3   Seemed a very sleepy show. Always seems to be with the New Years. 3 mins after Terrapin was ok.
30-12-80    3.5 Best Truckin' jam for a long time, but that was the only thing that stood out. Saving themselves?
31-12-80    3.5 A little lazy and lacking in direction. Last acoustic set? Unusual dark space. Subdued show.

26-02-81    3.5 Crazy long He's Gone, but it lacked a little something with the rest of the second set.
27-02-81    3.5 Pig screaming and some dude says 'Hi!' in space. Excellent quality. Just lacking a decent jam.
28-02-81    3.5 Good Let It Grow, also a nice Terrapin. But yet again, merely "nice" and lacks a bit of drive.
02-03-81    3.5 Three Playin's! Very slow Shakedown to start first set. Slightly tired ending to the set.
03-03-81    3   Slow, grinding Deal to close 1st set. Lacks energy throughout, and not in a good way.
05-03-81    3.5 Second set starts with unique jam with no Jerry. That's all stopping it from a 3, to be honest.
06-03-81    3.5 Nice LIG > Deal to end the first set. Nothing major is standing out in early 1981 so far though.
07-03-81    4   Killer first set with 17min+ Bird Song. Interesting 2nd set jam. Energy dies away a bit after drums.
09-03-81    4   Both Estimated and UJB have good jams. Awesome Stella Blue. Very mellow second set.
10-03-81    3   Officially bored of Sailor/Saint now, even this 15 min version. Truckin' tried a jam.
12-03-81    3.5 Nice pre-drums jam of Terrapin > Playin' > He's Gone. But overall again missing some energy.
13-03-81    3   First set better than 2nd. Recently pace has been very similar for a whole show - not good!
14-03-81    3   Jerry riffs on Bach after Other One. Lazy second set apart from maybe the Stella Blue.
20-03-81    3.5 Back to London. Really good Deal. Good example of what was going on at the time, but nothing special.
21-03-81    3.5 Dad's first show. Nice space into NFA. Very similar feel to the previous night.
23-03-81    4   Good overall show with good first set and decent versions of Playin' and Stella Blue.
24-03-81    4   Sound quality just so-so, but a nice mellow jam in He's Gone. Screw up in encore - Jerry says sorry.
28-03-81    3.5 Rockpalast show, notable for that great Sugaree and Pete Townshend appearence. Better on video.
30-04-81    3.5 Nice Estimated and Shakedown, but speedy Eyes. Show kinda goes downhill shortly into the 2nd set.
01-05-81    3.5 Continuing the long running "nice but not naughty" run of shows lacking bite. Stranger was good.
02-05-81    3.5 Still a little cruising. The NFA was a hint to the future though, with Bobby pushing the audience.
04-05-81    4   Very unfortunate cut in drums space. Good show until post drums. Playin' of the year?
05-05-81    4   Truckin' with a hint of Spanish jam in it. Second set didn't really have a clunker either.
06-05-81    4.5 Bobby Sands He's Gone. One of the very best post '74 jams so far. Rest of show suffers by comparison.
07-05-81    3   Tom Synder TV show. More fun seeing this on video, it is pretty standard stuff with no jams.
08-05-81    4   Awesome setlist. Only 1 hour for first set. As a show, better than 2 nights ago, but lacked a crazy jam.
09-05-81    4   Very messy Eyes, but jam afterwards was good. Great space. Screw up in Brokedown Palace encore.
11-05-81    3   First Brent scat singing in CC Rider. Weakest Playin Reprise I ever heard. Mostly uninspirational.
12-05-81    3.5 Bob Marley He's Gone. This song is THE major jam vehicle nowadays - which is why this is not a 3.           
13-05-81    3.5 Another cracking Deal. First sets these days are very reliable. First Aiko. Good Stella  Blue.
15-05-81    3   Bob Marley inspired Estimated, although this show didn't seem to give any other highlights.
16-05-81    4.5 Spanish jam is short but very good. Second set is better than the first, and a great UJB encore.
17-05-81    3.5 Slightly anonymous compared to the previous night. Unusual but short Other One before drums.
22-05-81    4   Benefit gig with John Kahn on bass. Interesting, with a few semi-decent jams. Kahn blamed for early finish.
02-07-81    3   First Man Smart. Eyes was ok but was too short. Largely unmemorable, except the new song.
04-07-81    4   What a setlist! Excellent Playing', with Bob led guitar jam at end. One more 4th of July.
05-07-81    4   Feelin Groovy jam in Shakedown, first song! Other One also good. Let down by setlist and pre-drums.
07-07-81    3   Except for the firts Dancin' for a while, this show has nothing special. Eyes was fast again.
08-07-81    3   Tape doesn't sound good. Hot Sugar Mag to finish, otherwise lacked a bit of sparkle and fun.
10-07-81    3.5 Weird jammed out post-drums setlist with Bobby ripcording Playin' reprise. Could have been better.
11-07-81    4   A decent Truckin' jam for a change with a touch of Spanish. Best Truckin' of the 80's so far?
13-07-81    3   Lots of vocal errors in Terrapin, on the other hand the best Satisfaction encore to date.
14-07-81    3   2 long jams (Shakedown and Eyes) that don't really go anywhere. Car crash Good Lovin' intro.
12-08-81    4   Best spanish jam and Morning Dew for a long time. Cheesy Truckin' intro got old very fast though.
14-08-81    3.5 I enjoyed the set list and encore but it's not great sq wise and fails to really spark at any point.
15-08-81    3.5 Surprisingly rough aud for the time, probably the worst of the 1980s. Nice jam after Terrapin though.
16-08-81    3   Slightly rough SBD. Short first set. Weird drums with the Pranksters. Lacked a lot of excitement.
27-08-81    3   Note this second set is similar to the last show. Apart from the Cumberland breakout, nothing exciting.
28-08-81    4   Best Wheel ever? No flow though - highlights quite segmented. Spanish jam after drums.
30-08-81    4   Lovely post-drums, very mellow and some good song choices. Other One > Stella Blue is great.
31-08-81    4   Pretty decent first set. Most excellent Playin' > Drums > Space. Slightly messy ending. Needs a good source.
11-09-81    3.5 Joan Baez sings Happy Birthday to Hart. First Greek show. Nice setlist but no stand outs.
12-09-81    4   Killer CC Rider solo - phew! Also a good Shakedown to start the first set, always a good sign.
13-09-81    3.5 Nice show overall, and quite long. GDTRFB and Terrapin jam before Never Trust a Woman were the standouts.
25-09-81    3.5 Nice Bird Song. Possibly worst digi-noise of any soundboard so far. Strange split Sugar Mag at end.
26-09-81    4.5 Crazy second set setlist. Cracking show, from start to finish. Best show of 1981 so far.
27-09-81    4   A good show, although slightly pales in comparison to the previous night. Nice Spanish jam out of space.
30-09-81    3.5 Edinburgh! Not bad for a tour opener in a strange place. Would have been a good show to go to.
02-10-81    3.5 No messing around with this 2nd set, Playin' > Shakedown to open. Just a bit sloppy on the transistions.
03-10-81    3.5 Another good set list. Great space as well, but seemed to lose some energy post drums. A bit standard.
04-10-81    4   Good overall show with a really great jam out of Scarlet that went into Playing territory.
06-10-81    4.5 Blues for Allah jam for Anwar Sadat? Really good Estimated jam. Stella Blue ending is also magnificent.
08-10-81    4   Messy soundboard. Playing > Terrapin, 26 mins of excellence. Really great space as well.
10-10-81    3   Jerry low in the mix for half the first set. Post drums was decent, but that was it. Super fast Eyes as well.
11-10-81    3   Jerry + Bob at the Melkweg. Aud is a little rough and the set is short. Great occasion, so-so as a show.
12-10-81    3   It has a very strange pre-drums setlist, but lacks any exciting moments. First set probably the best.
13-10-81    3.5 Guitars die in Sugar Mag. Jam > Drums > Space > Spanish jam is best part, rest far more standard.
15-10-81    3.5 Oops concert in Amsterdam. An actual bass solo! Sloppy in places but something of interest in there.
16-10-81    3.5 It's a very strange setlist, but pretty short and not as impressive as I thought it should be.
17-10-81    3   Bit weak, except maybe for the end. Band hangover? Jerry seems to sing "US Booze" in the encore.
19-10-81    4   Barcelona. Very unusual solo Jerry before drums. Let It Grow is well worth a listen. Best Sugar Mag?
29-11-81    3   Nice jam after He's Gone but the post drums selection had little no no energy. 1st set is better.
30-11-81    2.5 Mack the knife get stopped after 1 verse. A bit so-so, and most unusual to see a stopped song.
02-12-81    3   Chunk of the 2nd set missing. Better than the last show, but nothing particularly standout.
03-12-81    3.5 Very fast end to Black Peter. Drums was listed but was more like space. Great Baby Blue at the end.
05-12-81    4   A WTF? CC Rider. Short but excellent space. One of the better 81 shows, even if the end lacks a little fire.
06-12-81    4   Nothing wrong with this show, with a really good space, maybe the best of the year. Also good Sugaree.
07-12-81    3.5 Again space was the best part, although nothing wrong with the Truckin' > Nobody's Fault afterwards.
09-12-81    3.5 Excellent China > Rider slightly ruined with Bob cheese. Second set was standard for the time.
12-12-81    3.5 Benefit with Joan Baez. GD only is a single set. Baez part was OK. GD set was "efficient".
26-12-81    4   Day at the dentist space with Eleven jam. Overall a good solid start to the new year run.
27-12-81    4   Bobby's singing extends into the jam in Playin' - which is a good version. Weak end to the show though.
28-12-81    3.5 Great sound quality but slipped a bit from the previous 2 nights. Space was quite structured for a change.
30-12-81    3.5 Solid but unspectacular, and like other years you feel they are holding back a bit for the next night.
31-12-81    4.5 Sheese this is a long show with a crazy setlist. Possibly the best show of the year though. Excellent!

16-02-82    3.5 Rough aud for the time. Sounds decent but hard to get through the murk. Set list was good though.
17-02-82    4   Straight out of the gate, and great quality as well! Good high energy - would reccomend.
19-02-82    3.5 Pretty rocky, and the second set pre-drums was not so exiting. But overall not a bad show.
20-02-82    4   Unique keyboard jam from a long Playin' into drums, also the jamming continued well into the space.
21-02-82    3.5 Pretty rocking through most of the show, but pedestrian in the jams. Best song was the opening Shakedown.  
13-03-82    3   Aside from a slight Dear Prudence jam out of the Other One, nothing much to report on this one.
02-04-82    4   Better than the previous night. Truckin' onwards was really well done and at times unique.
03-04-82    3.5 This Eyes is almost wrong in a strange way. This is also the first NFA chant I heard the audience do.
05-04-82    3.5 Nice jam with the Playin at the start of the 2nd set, but otherwise fairly normal fare for the time.
06-04-82    4   Call-response in Shakedown. Any show of this era with a Dew is normally good, despite a Truckin' whistle.
08-04-82    3.5 Fairly good pre-drums and space. Not a bad little show but it didn't have any real standouts.
09-04-82    3   No jamming to speak of and the tunes are fairly short. At least the Miller board sounds good.
11-04-82    3   First croaky Jerry? Decent Let It Grow, but the rest of the show felt a little phoned in.
12-04-82    3.5 Unusual Iko opener and 2nd set Sugaree. Experimental Estimated Prophet ending. Tiny space tiger. Solid.
14-04-82    3   Set list looked good but Jerry was off the stage less than 25 minutes into the 2nd set. Unspectacular.
15-04-82    3   Bob screw-up in Estimated. Again Jerry slopes off early pre-drums. Hint of MLB! Not the best Dew to end.
17-04-82    3   Jerry is off stage ASAP pre-drums. Band turn around to sing the encore, which is a great version of Baby Blue.
18-04-82    3.5 Phil's Earthquake space show. Nice, Playin', although short. Average, apart from the space and the Playing.
19-04-82    4   Weir "8 bars". Hart: "Don't plan it, you'll forget!". Another Estimated loop-back. "More Nitrous!".
21-05-82    3.5 Short 2nd set. Jerry is off stage after 24 minutes! Nice set list but it lacked surprises.
22-05-82    3   Continuing the trend of not very exciting shows so far this year. The pace needs to change more often.
23-05-82    3   Jerry runs off stage again. Motorbike in space with Mickey directing. The unknown is dissapearing.
28-05-82    3.5 Benefit gig. Pretty bad SBD. Mad drumming. Amusing, but only for the guests. Is Jerry totally out of it?
17-07-82    3.5 Best Truckin' for a while, as it ends the 1st set. Jerry off stage quick again. Annoying Bobby singing.
18-07-82    3.5 Longest song is in first set. Comeback for Crazy Fingers and decent Wharf Rat make this not so bad.
25-07-82    3.5 Above average first set. Slow, groovy Samson. Long Estimated jam, although again pre-drums jam misses Jerry.
27-07-82    4   Really good pre-drums, just Playin' > Terrapin for 30 mins. Decent first set as well. Good show.
28-07-82    4   Agonising St Stephen hint after drums. Decent Phil-led Other One as well. Not quite as good as last night.
29-07-82    3.5 3rd night at Red Rocks. A decent show but I didn't recall any obvious highlights. First set was the best.
31-07-82    3.5 Mellow show. Jerry practically flies off stage pre-drums, so we get another Brent/Bobby jam again.
01-08-82    3   Jerrys 40th. Not bad in places, but the band sound a bit tired. No encore on my version, either.
03-08-82    3.5 He's Gone post drums? Best tunes were Jerry ones, but he has a bad voice for this. Shakedown was good.
04-08-82    3   Shows now have Bob + Brent > Drums > Space when Jerry quits early, as here. No suprises in this show.
06-08-82    3.5 Bob calls out an audience member for first aid notice. Great space. Too furious at the end - 3 rockers!
07-08-82    4.5 Who is Phil Ruth? Grabs from the start. Mad drums. Proper space. Excellent all-round show.
08-08-82    3.5 Estimated screwup. Cippolina as guest adds little. Show couldn't hold up to the previous nights.
10-08-82    3   Stranger was a reasonable start but other than drums space nothing lit me up really. Average.     
28-08-82    2.5 Joke of a start for set 2 after Ken Babbs intro. Largely insipid and the "jam" seem dialled in.
29-08-82    3.5 No space in this short (2h 15) show, maybe tired after the previous night? Let It Grow was good.
05-09-82    4   US festival, start at 9:30. Good for such an early start and a short show. Start was one of the best.
09-09-82    3.5 Massive difference between AUD patch and SBD! Bob bales early in set 1. A bit all over the place.
11-09-82    3   Badly out of tune in TLEO. Another good LIG. Still annoyed about Around & Around changes. No surprises.
12-09-82    3.5 Professional sounding, Phil really low in the mix. PITB not too shabby. Still, lacked that special spark.
14-09-82    3   First sets running for an hour are not uncommon now, as in this show. Not inoffensive, which was the problem.
15-09-82    4.5 SQ sucks a little, but: weirdest first set since 1970? First Touch Of Grey. You can hear Phil. PITB everywhere. 
17-09-82    3.5 Weird singing on first Throwing Stones. Audience "Phil" chant. Too many songs, not enough jams.
18-09-82    3.5 Apparently a Watchtower jam but I missed that. First set seemed cut short. Bobby repeats the birthday gag.
20-09-82    3   A tinkle of colour in the Spanish Jam and a starting Shakedown is usually a good thing, but no excitement here.
21-09-82    3.5 First Stones>NFA. PITB opener. Nice Estimated. Like a lot the period, doesn't flow so well.
23-09-82    3   Is Throwing Stones on every show since in this run? Good on the energy front, but no real flow between songs.
24-09-82    3   Tour ender to a strange tour. I can hear Phil. Weird jam in Throwing Stones. Bob's 5th wedding anniversary!
09-10-82    3.5 "Had her head re-arranged", new lyric in the last 2 Truckin's. Good Eyes, and the Dew was better than the last.
10-10-82    3   Disjointed pre-drums. Certainly no big jams at all. "Vote yes on 12" (freeze Nuclear Weapons). So-so.
17-10-82    3   Aud. Setlist a bit better than recently. Song to song with no jams though. Throwing Stones is still wrong.
26-11-82    3.5 Only show in Jamaica, Sound issues at start. Messy but cool first set. Not bad but a bit short for me.
26-12-82    4   First show with 6 string bass. Great bass sound! Hot China > Rider. Great Eyes. All round good show.
27-12-82    3.5 Scarlet > Fire / Playin pre drums was nice but the set seemed to tail off a lot after that. Average.
28-12-82    3.5 Bass sound has improved since the 6 string. Jerry screws up Shakedown and Terrapin lyrics. Nice encore.
30-12-82    3.5 Unusual 1st set setlist. "Say your piece and piss off?". Nice Stella Blue. Another "not bad" from this run.
31-12-82    3   Tired first set. Deal at end of 2nd set? "Holy fuck, look at all those balloons". Not a good new year show.

25-03-83    3.5 First set messy except for a decent LIG. 2nd set was decent pre-drums. Overall slighty anonymous.
26-03-83    2.5 Can't say any of this really made me appreciate the show. No real jamming and the SQ wasn't great either.
27-03-83    2.5 Messy. Haven't heard any decent Jerry for 2 whole shows. He sounds not with it at all this night.
29-03-83    2.5 3 shows without a SBD, and none of the auds sound decent. Help > Slipknot is nice enough, but can't carry a show.
30-03-83    3   Better quality but still a lack of energy. Really good drums/space. Rare China Doll. Low energy at end.
31-03-83    2.5 Stranger screw-up at end. Not a good setlist pre-drums. Super slow back Throwing Stones. Messy and lazy.
09-04-83    3.5 Jerry's voice has not been good this year. Still, a SBD at last. Nice Help / Slip. Not too shabby a show.
10-04-83    3   Pre-drums was decent enough. Jerry seems a little off tonight though; the mistakes are minor but noticable.
12-04-83    3.5 Decent 1st set with great set-list. Mellow throughout, with excellent sound quality. First NFA end -> encore.
13-04-83    3.5 Long and decent Scarlet Fire. Jerry's voice very croaky. Maybe You Know really cheesy. Post drums was ok.
15-04-83    3.5 Maybe You Know is the worst GD song to date. First Bob Star. Great space. Decent, but room for improvement.
16-04-83    4   With Stephen Stills, who is a good add for the most part. Nice pre-drums jam as well. Decent second set.
17-04-83    4.5 Good Let It Grow and first set. One of the best Playings for a long time. Awesome space. Love the one you're with!
19-04-83    3.5 Long ass Sugaree that failed to stand out. Spanish jam after drums could have gone somewhere.
20-04-83    3.5 Some SBD static. China Rider and the space are decent. Throwing Stones is slowly getting there. Acceptable. 
22-04-83    3.5 This was nearly a 4, since most everything from drums was pretty sublime, missing that 80's "rush".
23-04-83    4   Funny Saint Of Circumstance mess-up. Best Other One for a long long time. Some weird stereo artifacts on the SBD.
25-04-83    3.5 Pretty good feel in the 1st set and nice little pre-drums Playin > Terrapin. Solid but unspectacular.
26-04-83    3.5 NFA chants at the end of shows are becoming the norm. This was a decent show but not a stormer. Good Slipknot.
13-05-83    3.5 First Hell In A Bucket. Shows recently have been very solid but lacking a little; even this, despite a 20 min Eyes
14-05-83    3.5 What a great second set setlist! Short but decent Playin'. Good Morning Dew as well. Just needed a bit more energy.
15-05-83    4   Great first set. Airto, Flora, Cippolina guest. Modern NFA chant. Space, drums, guests and setlist are all good.
18-06-83    4   Setlists recently are great. Hell In A Bucket still has issues. This would be an awesome SBD release.
20-06-83    3.5 This is a wonderful show, but not really for the music. Phil's antics after lightning strikes are fun though.
21-06-83    3.5 Decent Looks Like Rain after last night. Probably the best part of the show. Second set lacks in jams somewhat.
22-06-83    3   Short and not very good first set. Lacked any major sparkle. Playing jam before drums was the highlight.
24-06-83    3.5 Truckin cocaine line is back. Pleasant enough Truckin > Dew post drums but nothing with a lot of meat.
25-06-83    3.5 Jerry seems out of it. Throwing Stones is still slowly getting there. Punchy end to the second set. Average.
27-06-83    3   Lots of auds at the moment. Nothing wrong, but nothing exciting. Setlists have improved over a year or so ago.
28-06-83    4   Another fairly short 1st set, although it wasn't bad. Second set though, not bad at all. Another NFA chant.
30-07-83    2.5 Very swirly aud. China Doll has all the tempos at once. Rushed throughout, no particular highlights.
31-07-83    3.5 Finally a great sounding SBD. Almost a jam out of HIAB. 50 mins post drums! However, it's a bit pedestrian.
20-08-83    3   Shakedown Street set 2 opener and Deal set 1 closer were the best - the rest was average for the time.
21-08-83    3   Second set had a good set-list but overall not a stand-out show. Weird start with a Cassidy opener though.      
26-08-83    3   Distant sounding audience does not inspire. First Wang Dang Doodle out of space? Strange placement.
27-08-83    3.5 Jack Start open and pre-drums was quite nice, the rest a little ho-hum. Although the aud tape was pretty decent.
29-08-83    3   Funky HIAB, and nice seperation on the Shakedown starter. These shows are definitly worse than the spring tour.
30-08-83    4   Intro with Kesey is quite fun. Smoothest ever Terrapin breakdown and re-intro. Throwing Stones good as well.
31-08-83    3.5 Nice Stella Blue (regularly good) and the Playing jam had some decent wah going on, but nothing else stood out.
02-09-83    3.5 What the heck is Weir playing during the Throwing Stones jam? Victim? Messed up Sugar Mag end. Solid show.
04-09-83    4   Great quality soundboard. More botched than normal '83 Around & Around. Generally decent, especially post drums.
06-09-83    4   Red Rocks 83. Help > Slip > Franklins into a Playin sandwich? Yes please! Throwing Stones jams are great recently.
07-09-83    3.5 Eyes hint in a long space. Not a bad show but lacked the highlights and decent setlist of the previous night.
08-09-83    3.5 3rd night at Red Rocks failed to top the first one. Had maybe the best first set though of the run though.
10-09-83    3   Another show where Jerry stage exits pretty fast pre-drums. Cold Rain & Snow encore. A bit subdued in the 2nd set.
11-09-83    3.5 Setlist was pretty good, with a long LiG in the 2nd set AND a Dew as well, but it did not spark for me.
13-09-83    3   Holy 31 min Scarlet > Fire! No Jery ballad post drums either. Maybe unusual, but musically nothing special.
18-09-83    4   Polarising views on archive! Great Terrapin > D/S > Wharf Rat combo. A pretty decent show overall.
24-09-83    3   UJB was fun but overall this was a slightly wimpy show, nothing really punching out and grabbing my attention,
08-10-83    3   A pretty short show (2h 15m in total). Most strange Sugar Mag > Good Lovin intro mix. Quite rushed throughout.
09-10-83    3   Quite the speedy intro into Eyes. All pre drums is rushed. Another short show, 68 mins for the second set.
11-10-83    3   Digital aud. Day Job goes funny. Another short 2nd set, the comeback of St Stephen, although patchy, was the best part.
12-10-83    3.5 First Revolution. Slightly modern-ish drums/space. There is a lack of excitement, except maybe in the H>S>F.
14-10-83    3.5 Trey's first show. Slightly anonymous but decent first set. Epic Scarlet > Fire. No big contrasts in songs though.
15-10-83    3.5 Quality 2nd set setlist. This St. Stephen better than the last one. Decent playing but still missing that something.
17-10-83    3.5 Great first set, average song length > 10 mins! Second set is fairly normal. Jerry sounds out of it - no emotion.
18-10-83    3.5 Energetic start. Great LL > Supplication. China Rider full of energy. Rushed in parts though, especially post drums.
20-10-83    4   Another energy-filled first set. Jerry screws up Samson and the start of Stella Blue, but rest of set is decent.
21-10-83    4   Great pre-drums continues into unique Bob + Jerry mellow guitar-off in space. First chorus for Bob? Decent.
22-10-83    3.5 First set was decent and space was worth it, but the rest was subdued par-for-the-course 1983. A bit short as well.
30-10-83    3   Setlist was nice but the board was flat and lifeless, a little bit like the show. Spoonful jam was ok.
31-10-83    4   Last St Stephen. Drums with Aierto - the best guest? It's a decent show, but has no proper jams outside space.
27-12-83    3.5 Jerry seems pretty out of it. Another heck of a 30 min Scarlet > Fire, common in this period. Solid but no more.
28-12-83    3.5 Great first set and opening, the 2nd set is a little lackluster. Good set list though, and high energy to start.
30-12-83    3.5 A MLB jam! Was a bit of a tease though. Another marathon Shakedown. Not as quiet as the usual pre new year shows.
31-12-83    3   Not the best new years. Normal show with an added, messed up third set with unusual guests. Jerry really gone.

28-03-84    3   So-so audience, in a small venue. Weir misses first song of second set. Bad, first, Don't Need Love pre drums. Rushed.
29-03-84    3.5 Glorious 2nd set setlist. Bobby with a ring mod in Rooster? Hard to hear Jerry sometimes. Long space. Solid.
31-03-84    4   Gratuitous echo and reverb on vocal jam out of He's Gone. New effects in space. All the new effects are great.
01-04-84    3.5 Jerry in good voice for a change. Another good space. Tape sounds nice, but overall not as much fun as last night.
06-04-84    3   Black Peter for the death of a fan. Seconds set runs low on energy near the end. Weird Eyes out of Space.
07-04-84    3   Sloppy and lacking in energy pre-drums. Keyboard really out of tune - with ring mod? Spanish jam saves the day.
13-04-84    3   Good SBD, with nice Bird Song in first set. Estimated was actually jammed decently at the outro. Nice bass sound.
14-04-84    3.5 Short show (2h 10m). Good Stranger to start. Brent songs pre-drums don't do it for me. No real screw-ups though.
16-04-84    3   Nice Shakedown to start then the 1st set went to normal. Second set nothing stand-out. Also no howler though.
17-04-84    3   Niagara falls, literally right next to Canada. "Step back" with digital delay. These shows lack any bite.
19-04-84    3.5 Slightly epic Bird Song in first set. Jerry sounds out of it in Terrapin. Great end to Wharf Rat. Overall not bad.
20-04-84    3.5 Good long Let It Grow to end first set. Samson > Drums? Feels like a by-the-numbers show though. Is it an 84 thing?
21-04-84    4   Very decent HSF that goes straight into Playin', ruined by Don't Need Love. Very good Wharf Rat > Stones > NFA
23-04-84    3.5 Bob loses his vioice during HIAB; Jerry sounds doped up. 45 min first set! Only a Fool is truly dreadful.
24-04-84    3   Moderate. Shows are less surprising than 83. They miss "flow". Bob's fight with his voice is still present.
26-04-84    3.5 Another long Scarlet Fire. Almost 60 mins pre-drums, but then another Brent song. Meaty Morning Dew.
27-04-84    2.5 Nice Playin' jam for 10 minutes but nothing else about the show stands out. Bit of yawn, with low energy.
29-04-84    3   Why does Brent insist on doing a number pre-drums? Terrapin has a jam. Nothing stand out in all of 84 so far.
30-04-84    3.5 Excellent Drums > Space. Lacks energy post drums (or is pretty mellow). Throwing Stones had a bit of a crash.
06-05-84    3.5 Low speed first set; 84 so far seems low energy. Touch is all over the place. Decent space. Second set had variety.
07-05-84    3.5 Another good space. In some ways, nearly a 4, but infected with that lack of energy. China Rider is a weird one.
08-05-84    3.5 Nearly fell asleep at the start. Jerry out of it. Space > Other One is decent. Jerry's voice for Dew is very froggy.
09-06-84    4   Brent has a ring modulator. Short first set. Ragged as usual now. From Playin' onwards is pretty decent.
10-06-84    3.5 More energy than recent shows. Unfortunate Don't Need Love after nice He's Gone jam. Good space, as is usual now.
12-06-84    3   Slightly more energy. Scarlet > Touch second time still didn't work. Rest of set was pretty ho-hum.
13-06-84    3.5 Summer 84 is definitly better than spring. Let It Grow into drums is the highlight, but still lacks excitement.
14-06-84    3   Awesome 2nd set setlist. Horrible mess going into first Fantasy. Seemed to be a lot of wasted potential.
21-06-84    3   Encore with Rick Danko. Long, decent Scarlet Fire at the start of the second set failed to carry over.
23-06-84    2.5 84 just seems to lack surprise. Junkie Jerry mostly fails to show. Weird clapping out of space from audience.
24-06-84    4   Jerry hints Dancin' about 15 times. Excellent Minglewood. Playin' > China is great, and post drums retains energy.
26-06-84    4   Casey Jones opener! He's Gone is best jam of the year so far. Even keeps the action going post drums. Best of '84.
27-06-84    4   Good from the start. Long LiG to finish first set. Help > Slip! WDWDIITR a mess. Space > Dew! Solid show.
29-06-84    3   Rough aud for first set. Scarlet > Touch not a hit. Rest of show was normal 84, lacked some of the recent highs.
30-06-84    4   On a tennis court. Excellent pre-drums Shakdown > Playing > Terrapin. Post drums tails a bit. Another 'best 84'!
01-07-84    3   Interesting He's Gone jam for the last few minutes. Rest of the show is "nothing bad", but nothing special either.
03-07-84    3.5 Scarlet > Touch > Fire best so far, before Don't Need Love appears pre-drums. Post drums is less exciting.
04-07-84    3.5 Weird humming in FOTD. Help > Slip and He's Gone had stuff to offer. The latter was for the death of a fan.
06-07-84    3.5 2 songs take up last 28 mins of first set. Best Mr Fantasy so far. Around & Around is a total train wreck.
07-07-84    3   Pre-drums had an interesting Playing > China Doll. First real Lovelight for ages. But generally pretty average.
13-07-84    4   Dark star encore! Rest of show is middling (though good SQ) quality. Dark Star though is good and worth a listen.
14-07-84    3   Some great Phil here. Pretty mellow throughout, although it meanders into forgettable territory sometimes.
15-07-84    4   First set is ok, but second is pretty decent. Jerry stays for Don't Need Love; Double encore. Phil speaks!
21-07-84    3.5 Finally the Brent song is not pre-drums. Competent throughout, sounded nice but really lacked excitement.
22-07-84    3.5 Dancin' is the new opener. Jerry's voice a little better recently. Nice transition from space to Dew. Solid.
05-10-84    3.5 Long China > Rider (14 mins). Double intro of Sugar Mag. This is better than spring. Jerry says a word!
06-10-84    3   Aside from a jammy China Doll, this show has no stand-outs, and the sound quality is only so-so. Missable.
09-10-84    3.5 Jack Straw in the 2nd set? Really nice LiG. Unusual set-list. Post drums loses the excitement a little.
11-10-84    3.5 15 min Shakedown to start! Spaciest Playin' for years, with feedback before drums. Dodgy post drums though.
12-10-84    4   Jack-A-Roe for Phil? Gets serious after Don't Need Love. Great Uncle John's. Sound quality dips in second set.
14-10-84    3.5 First set Miracle. 20 minute Eyes! Vocal effects OTT in Throwing Stones (which has first (?) standard chords in jam).
15-10-84    3.5 Slighty perkier first set than usual. Second set Scarlet > Fire > Playin' is 50 minutes long! Samey jamming.
17-10-84    3   Another "quite good" first set. Long Terrapin. Slightly rushed post drums. Whistle for Truckin is awful loud.
18-10-84    3.5 Good Stranger opener. Actually has a nice set-list but lacks unusual elements. Nice digital effects in space.
20-10-84    3.5 Nice Smokestack into a short jam and a very short drums. Post drums is by the numbers. Lovelight back in the mix.
27-10-84    3   Wang Dang Doogle in 2nd set. Don't Need Love pre-drums. Brent's Truckin' intro kills me. GDTRFB intro train wreck.
28-10-84    3.5 Short but sweet first set. Mixed dipped in second set but not bad. Crowd try NFA chant but get it wrong.
30-10-84    3   Another short first set. Slips to slightly ropey aud for much of the second set. Too much delay in the space(!).
31-10-84    3   Matt Kelly and "Ain't Superstitous" are nice. Great bird noises in space. Definitly needs some more excitement.
02-11-84    2.5 Short, iffy first set. H>S>F is messy. Wharf Rat pre-drums? Good Lovin very messy. Chaotic everywhere, underwhelming.
03-11-84    2   Worst first set for a long long time. Not 1 normal song pre-drums! Embarrassing, slighty better post drums.
28-12-84    3   Mercifully better than the previous show. First Tons Of Steel and (bad) Day Tripper. Nothing stands out.
29-12-84    3.5 Playin' > Drums > Space is 45 minutes long! Easily the best Playin' of 1984. Rest is quite pedestrian though.
31-12-84    4   Crazy Shakedown opener. Throwing Stones jam is now complete. Show is out the door like a rocket, eases off later on.

18-02-85    3   Mixed up setlist. Up and down all over the place. GDTRFB into drums? Needed more stability (and more jams, of course).
19-02-85    3   Flanger on some vocals. Split Women / Aiko / Women, but it lacks any fizz. Not wrong, but little to salvage that shines.
20-02-85    2.5 Bob's voice is shot. Day Tripper is terrible. Start of second set is ok, but the fizzle dies early. Bob speaks Chinese.
09-03-85    3.5 Voices much better. Features a really good space / Twilight Zone exploration. Very little jaming outside this though.
10-03-85    3   Not a great aud. Minor MLB jam out of Smokestack pre-drums, but everything else a little lazy and lacking in bite.
12-03-85    2.5 Really short show. Playin' was long but didn't go anywhere interesting. No real direction after the second song.
13-03-85    3.5 Hot Deal to close enjoyable first set. Estimated solo was rocking. Second set was enjoyable, lacked killer touch.
21-03-85    4   Arrives in a hot swirl of dolby and warble. Best first set for a long time. Nice Playin', and a decent show.
22-03-85    3.5 Great tape for audience reactions. Another Scarlet > Hell. Decent space. Not bad, previous night was better though.
24-03-85    3   Another up-tempo first set. Second set was solid but rather flat throughout. Nice, but really needed more nasty.
25-03-85    3   Pre drums had a decent setlist that was well executed, but it lacked an edge, or some fizz. Post drums getting shorter.
27-03-85    3   First Phil song since 1974 (?). Half Step is back. Most of the show is pretty rushed. Total car crash Touch encore.
28-03-85    3.5 Truckin' opener! Good first set. Wierd LLR jam into drums. Better than last year, but not consistent over the whole show.
29-03-85    3   Solitary Supplication jam in first set. Weird second set setlist pre-drums. Quite good energy but low on jamming.
31-03-85    3   Seems stuck in the same groove. First set was anonymous. Unexpected post-drums playing saves the day a little. Not great.
01-04-85    3   Similar to the previous night - consistency in areas you want inconsistency. Phil sings again. Weird end to NFA.
03-04-85    3   Second set Terrapin open has promise but then it devolves to strict 10 minute songs; common in this era. So-So.
04-04-85    3   Crazy Fingers started in double time! Pretty rocking GDTRFB into drums. 85 is messing with setlists, doesn't always work.
06-04-85    3.5 Jerry's voice is pretty bad tonight. 4 songs before drums not too bad tonight, but lack gusto. Energy better after drums.
07-04-85    3.5 Short but decent first set, with good Bird Song. Second set setlists weirder, but not always better. Post drums not bad.
08-04-85    3.5 Jerry's voice is getting worse! Strange but not bad first set. Nothing in second set runs over time, except maybe Lovelight.
13-04-85    3.5 Decent but short Playin' jam. A bit better than previous shows (even the Truckin' was decent). Weird start to Sat Night.
14-04-85    3.5 Definitly getting better but not getting there yet. Decent space, but lacked intensity outside this. Not bad though.
27-04-85    3.5 Stunning board. Very tight and enjoyable first set. Second set is pleasent and lacks adventure. Seques are nice though.
28-04-85    3.5 Another good first set. Triple Playin' jam in second set, which has a great flow. Nearly a 4, but lacks something.
14-06-85    3   20th anniversary shows. Nice to see Stagger Lee back. Unusual Dew to start second set but lacked much of musical interest.
15-06-85    3.5 Jerry's voice better than the spring. These 84 shows have some strange songs but lack flow in between them. Awesome encore.
16-06-85    3.5 Solid but unsurprising first set. First Cryptical for ages doesn't do anyhting special. First MIDI space is interesting.
21-06-85    3.5 The score is for the decent Estimated > Eyes pre drums; although the transition ionto GDTRFB was also decent.
22-06-85    3   Nothing special in this show. New Half-Step is too fast and there is no jamming in the second set. Anonymous.
24-06-85    3   Bob: "The raffle winner gets to hold the rhythm section hostage". This show has too many short songs in both sets.
25-06-85    3.5 Pretty decent attempt at a Playin' jam, though it failed to really space out. Too many short songs all over again.
27-06-85    3.5 Weird but decent first set. Great Stranger > Eyes transition. Unfortunatly, This seems the year of the ripcord. Good end.
28-06-85    3.5 Finally, a second set with some lengthy songs. Great MNS. Bit less bitty than the last few shows but still a bit average.
30-06-85    3.5 First MIDI from Brent in CC Rider? Decent Shakedown, but not the best. New effects in space, decent Stella Blue. Nearly a 4.
01-07-85    3.5 Decent setlist could not hide the lack of exploration. 1985 seems more professional but less on the ragged edge.
02-07-85    3   Quite short for both sets. Terrapin before drums is the highlight at 13 minutes long. Lovely car crash in Brokedown Palace.
13-07-85    3   Bizarre Sat. Night > Fire opener. Again in 1985 the changes are more in the setlist than in the music. Nasty static on SBD.
14-07-85    3   Eyes managed to sneak over the 10 minute line. End of drums and into space was good (although drums cut). Short on improv.
24-08-85    3   Infamous Boreal Ridge show. PA has many issues. Car crash HIAB is great. Not entirely dreadful, but not a great show.
30-08-85    3.5 Much less issues than the previous show. Quite "clean"; practically no adventure at all. Nice Good Lovin and Dew though.
31-08-85    3.5 The best audio is a pretty windy aud unfortunatly. Highlights were the LiG, Estimated and the encore. Nothing exceptional.
02-09-85    3.5 Decent energy opener. Killer bass in Uncle (!). Great Playin' and an averted Don't Need Love. Show could not sustain itself.
03-09-85    3   Cryptical > Other One > Cryptical in 11 minutes; sad. Both songs have slipped over the years. No particular highlights.
05-09-85    3.5 Unusually un-modern (for '85) setlist. Car crash Brokedown Palace encore. Mostly nicely done, except for no surprises at all.
06-09-85    3   Only 2 hours of music - including Healy's burp! Are they saving themselves for the next night? Nothing unusual, tired in places.
07-09-85    3.5 Opens with Bob madness. Very unusual Sat night to close 1st set. Decent overall second set. Still can't climb to a 4 though.
10-09-85    3   Awful car-crash Brent tune before drums. Almost got jammed, it went so haywire. Rest is normal 85, and speedy after drums.
11-09-85    3   Promised land in middle of first set? Second set is transparently without jamming. Space was not bad. Lacks adventure.
12-09-85    3.5 Above average setlist. Last H>S>F for a few years. About as good as 85 goes; nothing particularly standout, but well played.
15-09-85    4   Around > D/S > US Blues? A very strange show with regard to setlists, and decent for it. Super short post drums.
25-10-85    4   Deal opener? Dew opener? Not bad up until the car crash Sugar Mag. Better than others of this era, but had more potential.
26-10-85    3   Gimme Some Lovin' opener. Brent song pre drums kills the mood. Post drums was decent, overall lacks in excitement.
28-10-85    3   Scarlet > Touch again. This one really floated over me, although none of it was especially bad; a normal 1985 complaint.
29-10-85    3.5 Lost Sailor > Saint eats up jam time from second set. Good Crazy Fingers into long 9 minutes jam. Rest as expected.
31-10-85    4   Opens with Space > Werewolves! Short, but probably the best second set of 1985 so far. 2nd set has a great setlist.
01-11-85    3.5 Decent first set leads to 3 Jerry ballads pre drums. Sailor Saint split over drums. Unusual song choice to set 2 as well.
02-11-85    4   Pretty decent first set with nice Let It Grow. Second set has a great setlist. Best Dew for a long time. Decent show.
04-11-85    3.5 It's not a bad show, but the setlist looks so 1977 it can't help but fail by comparison. Bob spits out Cocaine.
05-11-85    3.5 Are the setlists the best thing about 1985? Bird Song with birds. Nice show overall, but needed just that little something.
07-11-85    3.5 12 songs in the first set! Rare Let It Grow into drums. Throwing Stones > NFA is now well established. Average for the time.
08-11-85    4   Nobody has a birthday! Really good space with weird sounds morphs into Other One with flanged voices. Great end to the show.
10-11-85    4   Excellent Stranger to end the first set. High energy pre-drums. Short on adventure but put together well as a whole.
11-11-85    3.5 Another early Deal. Decent ending trio for the first set. One of those shows that was nice but not at all naughty.
16-11-85    3   Muddy SBD. Strange pre-drums setlist. 2nd set starts with Tennessee Jed? Unfortunatly, a bit phoned in. Longest song in 1st set.
17-11-85    3   Brent slips another song in pre-drums. Why oh why? Rest of the show has no particular highlights, although encore is nice.
20-11-85    4   High Time in 1st set. Rare Sailor > Saint. Terrapin has jam of the year but Brent rams in "Don't Need Love" after 18 minutes.
21-11-85    4   Setlist of the year? Great Playing in the 2nd set. Second set is pretty good except last few songs. Is this encore unique?
22-11-85    3.5 Really short show - 2h 11m total. Excellent SBD. First set is pretty nice, second set is also not bad, just lacks invention.
30-12-85    3   Unusual opener but par for the course 1st set. Second set has that 'night before new year' trope of taking it easy.
31-12-85    3   Audience kick things off in the first set, but that is all of note in this most restrained new years show. Disappointing.

08-02-86    3   First Chinese new year show? Only 2hr 5m long. Slow first set. Playin' tries something of interest but otherwise so-so.
09-02-86    3   These shows keep getting shorter! Tired first set. Other One in set 2 is semi-decent for a change.Still no stand-outs though.
11-02-86    3   Second set largly with the Nevilles. Iko with key change? Nevilles add energy, but also too many drummers. Saved by the encore.
12-02-86    4   Post drums also with the Nevilles. Spacey Estimated jam. Crikey, a real bass player on stage. Hand Jive is great.
14-02-86    3   Jerry tries Lost Sailor > Terrapin but the band doesn't follow. Had no real meat to hang anything onto. Lovelight was ok.
19-03-86    3.5 First Visions of Johanna. Unfortunatly, even the board is shitty. Long and decent Playing. Weird middle to Truckin'.
20-03-86    3   Box Of Rain! Kudos to Brent who has a keys/drums jam instead of a song. Nothing much else to get fired up about.
21-03-86    3   A WTF? Let It Grow intro. Super-speedy Terrapin. Playin reprise into drums? Contains surprises, just not alays good ones.
23-03-86    3   Hand Jive much worse without the Nevilles. Wolf howling in Other One. Will the Other One ever go large again? Clean but mild.
24-03-86    3.5 Last Sailor Saint (!). Only one song out of space? Short show again. Phew, what a DEW! Likely best ending since 74.
25-03-86    2.5 Jeez the second set is full of short songs. First Desolation Row, it's already too long. Not really bad, more boring.
27-03-86    3   Supplication jam in first set. Only Hamstring Blues. Bob horrifically out of tune on Eyes. A bit better post drums.
28-03-86    3.5 Short but fairly sweet jam before drums. Get it for the flow, even though songs now are generally always 10 mins max.
30-03-86    3   Meant to be full of energy but I didn't find that. Gimme Some Lovin tease after drums was only thing of note.
31-03-86    3   Cut short because a thrown bottle went through Billys kick drum. Decent Comes A Time. Some silly songs spoil this.
01-04-86    3   Nice fat set on paper, but played a bit too fast and with little conviction. Shows recently are more and more samey.
03-04-86    2.5 Bobby just as loud as Jerry for a change! First set has longish songs but no jams. Boring Playing jam, Brent before drums.
04-04-86    2.5 Worst Jack Straw to start? Jerry seems to have no energy. Rough first set. Foolish Heart riff pre-drums? Is this the future?
12-04-86    2.5 Sounds like Brent has some new MIDI sounds. Sounds like Jerry is almost not there. He has no spark at all in these shows.
13-04-86    3   Desolation Row is too long. Jerry bales halfway through Terrapin, letting Brent in with Don't Need Love. Encore was ok.
18-04-86    2.5 Super rare That's Alright Mama (which is truly dreadful) in 10 song first set. Nothing at all stood out in the 2nd set.
19-04-86    4   2 songs pre-drums; 1 is a 15 min Playing. Long, but doesn't seem to go anywhere. Very mellow space. Clearly best of '86.
21-04-86    2.5 Brent has a skinful or three in the set break. Crazy breakdown, with Jerry rescuing things. Truly a unique dead show!
22-04-86    3   Good start to the first set and decent Bird Song. WTF is Brent playing in China Cat? Mellow half-jam out of Terrapin.
03-05-86    3.5 Short but sweet. Shows this year are way more up and down, and Jerry is often mixed low. Jerry's amp dies on the last note!
04-05-86    4   Seems to start with last nights encore. Really good Playin' jam - 15 minutes long. Faltered a bit towards the end.
10-05-86    3   Didn't have the lows of some recent shows but missed the minor highs as well. Let It Grow was probably the best moment.
11-05-86    3.5 Phil and Jerry speak at the start! Best 80's Dancin' in first set? Low energy in the second set. Strange double encore.
20-06-86    2.5 Bob introduces the band at the end in a cheesy way, the best thing about this show. Space was boring and Quinn is getting old.
21-06-86    3   Clifford Stoll was here. Almost ambient drums > space. Saint with no Sailor. Like a of 86, Jerry seems lethargic.
22-06-86    3   Second set opens with Fire On The Mountain! Quite a lot of songs and not short but it seems the band are done by the 2nd set.
26-06-86    2.5 One long set, which is nearly 2 hours long. Worst aud for a long, long time. Really, nothing at all stood out here.
28-06-86    3.5 Second set looks good on paper, and pre-drums is definitly quite nice. Unfortunatly rest of the show is more normal '86.
29-06-86    3   Less than 2 hours total for this show! Something is not right when Jerry goes for the big solos. Eyes is both fast AND short.
30-06-86    3   All the energy is at the start of these shows. This wasn't terrible, except maybe for song choice. No surprises.
02-07-86    3   Dylan joins for part of set 1 (not great). Jerry misses 10 minutes of set 2 (not bad). Overall though, nothing exciting.
04-07-86    3   Farm Aid show. Pretty much all short songs. Stand-alone Fire was pretty good. Fast paced and ragged throughout.
06-07-86    2.5 Too fast and too messy, although Let It Grow had a try at decency. Sloppy, bad audience tape and lacking in energy.
07-07-86    3   Again with Dylan for 2 songs, who plays the worst guitar ever at a Dead show. Jerry doesn't sound too bad on Wharf Rat.
15-12-86    3   Comeback show. It was a bit tighter than recently and had 2 new songs, but I wouldn't call it a classic show. So-so.
16-12-86    3   Slightly better than last night, still had that more professional feel, but nothing really stood out except Sugaree.
17-12-86    3.5 A decent length 2nd set at long last. This definitly has a better flow about it. Best show of the 3, decent throughout.
27-12-86    3.5 Sounding much better than the summer. A better band, even if the jams are not there. Playing sandwich for the whole show!
28-12-86    3.5 Slightly shorter, as if the band are getting ready for the new year shows again. Nothing outstanding, but overall decent.
30-12-86    3   Has 3 drums listed + Olin Arrageed! Ballads have got better on the comeback. Band cohesion is noticably better this tour.
31-12-86    3.5 Short 3rd set mixes things up a little. Jerry's voice a lot better than the summer. Still waiting for the jams though.

28-01-87    2   Bobby struggles to sing Get Back. Second set is a real clunker, possibly worst Eyes ever. Jerry forgets words everywhere.
29-01-87    2.5 Bobby struggles all evening since Otis just died. Jerry is better than last night, but that's not saying much.
30-01-87    3   Bob horrifically out of tune at points. 87 is slowly getting better but this was worst start to a year I remember.
01-03-87    3   Good Let It Grow in first set. Songs are starting to get longer again, and there are more, but it still lacks overall.
02-03-87    3.5 Shaky start to Jack Straw. SBD's recently are fantastic. Decent Stranger and Estimated, rest a bit muted. Not too bad.
03-03-87    3   Iko with horns, initially very messy. Nothing really else stood out in this show, to be honest - it was quite pedestrian.
22-03-87    3   First east coast show since the coma. Awful SBD. Unusual Sugar Mag sandwich for second set, but no real highlights.
23-03-87    3.5 Another board that sounds like an aud. Big River has an excellent Mydland solo. Good energy. Strong Eyes hint in space.
24-03-87    4   Energy from the off. Not a fan of these Healy ultra-mixes. High energy Terrapin. Great intro to Fantasy. A good show!
26-03-87    4   Either the mix or the sound system has changed since Summer 86 - for the better. Great first set, and decent energy all over.
27-03-87    3.5 What gives with these SBDs? Post drums short but sweet, UJB > Dew. Not a bad show, except for a screwup in Dew by Jerry.
29-03-87    3.5 This spring tour has loads of energy - it's off the charts here. Playing' was the best, setlist was like 86 but higher energy.
30-03-87    3.5 Really excellent first set. He's Gone dragged a bit, but one of the best Throwing Stones and a decnr post-drums.
31-03-87    4   Jerry really tries to twist the jam out of Estimated. Best Aroundx2 since the 70s? Like a steamroller to the head.
02-04-87    3.5 These shows are great in the energy department but they could do with a touch more jamming. Eyes is too short here.
03-04-87    3   Samson into drums is weird. Short Drums / Space. Other One starts with a semi-Spanish jam. Not as good as recent shows.
04-04-87    3   Energy a bit lower in this show. Still suffering from the "songs too short in second set" syndrome. Not a good Dew.
06-04-87    4   Holy shit what a Jack Straw solo! Terrapin out of space? Not a bad one though. Even other One got a little funky.
07-04-87    3.5 Great HIAB technical screw-up. Little Slipknot riff in space. Little bit less exciting than recent shows, but not bad.
09-04-87    3.5 Second set has a great playlist but's more of a tease, especially the 30 second Playing reprise. Overall, not so bad.
10-04-87    3   Energy from start of tour seems weakened by now, or perhaps it was just last night. First set better than the second.
11-04-87    3   Almost like 2 first sets; the curse of 1985 still extends it's hand. Space and the encore were the best parts of the show.
17-04-87    3   87 so far has islands of high energy shows but this is not one. Truckin falls flat, Jerry's voice falters and no jams.
18-04-87    3   Longish tuning melody in first set. Let It Grow not bad. Promoter warning after first set. Unfinished Dew!?! Not good.
19-04-87    3   Strange second set list (Muddy > Miracle > Cumberland > Drums ?). Nearly an Other One sandwich post drums. Recently lackluster.
02-05-87    3.5 Unusual Sat Night to end set 1. Good outro from space which was almost correct. Yet another Dew - and a decent one.
03-05-87    4   Bobby high in the mix. It's a killer sound and I enjoyed almost all of it. Fun tuning in the first set as well.
09-05-87    3   Rare Sugar Mag sandwich for show. Great Mexicali - Bob very clear. Brent: "I hope my bass player can give me some slack".
10-05-87    3.5 Bobby "way too fucking slow" in Man Smart. Decent Stranger in first setlist. Playin' post drums. Had potential. 
12-06-87    3.5 One of the better late China Riders. Brent has new violin sound. Overall nothing outstanding but it was a decent show.
13-06-87    3.5 Decent setlist. Pity The Other One is now a 5 minute post drums filler. Show was good but could have brought more fire.
14-06-87    3.5 Good, if predictable, post drums. Monkees in space. Throwing Stones always has the usual format now. Solid, unspectacular.
19-06-87    4   LSD warning at start of show. Great first set. Decent space as well. Not a great setlist but all the energy was there.
20-06-87    3   Weird second set start and pre-drums list. Deal > Drums? More song based than jam based. First Watchtower was ok enough.
21-06-87    4   Rare (now) Alabama opener. Brent's voice is gone. Unusual setlist, but done well. Masterpiece WTF. Best NFA for a long time.
26-06-87    3.5 No SBD for a change. Whale song pre-drums out of Eyes. High energy almost all of post-drums. Needed more exploration though.
27-06-87    3.5 Good Let It Grow. Setlist for set 2 is fantastic. Good drums. Good show overall, but lacked a special moment somewhere.
28-06-87    3.5 Very weird non-sung ending to what could have been a good Dew. Everything seems good again, just lacks the adventure.
30-06-87    3.5 Crowd very lively for Good Lovin' sing along. Energy is great again. The curse of 87 seems unwillingness to explore.
02-07-87    3.5 These shows have far more energy than recent years but lack inventivness. Enjoying the Muddy River encores though.
04-07-87    3   First Dylan + Dead show. Jerry on pedal steel! It's more Dylan than Dead though. Kinda glad there's only 6 at this point.
06-07-87    3   Pre-drums with the Nevilles (who always do the same songs). Sounded like more fun on stage - a strange Dead show.
07-07-87    3.5 Great Morning Dew was a welcome return to "normal Dead". 2 shows away and I'd already missed them! Still no real jamming.
08-07-87    3.5 Roanoke. Remember this one being well liked when it came out. Fullt of energy, happy sounding, no big jams - all 87.
10-07-87    3.5 1st and 2nd sets condensed. 3rd set with Dylan again. Better set than the last one, despite the Queen Jane car crash.
12-07-87    3   Dew to open short 2nd set. Third show with Dylan. Suffers from the band holding back because of the third set.
19-07-87    3   Again the GD seem to lack a bit of sparkle because of having to do 3 sets. Dylan sets starting to sound the same.
24-07-87    4   5th Dylan show! Longest Funinculi? Rare Scarlet > Playing. Dead ripping with energy. Possibly best Dylan set so far.
26-07-87    3   A semi-decent Other One. Longest Dylan set so far. This had different songs from the others, but previous night was better.
11-08-87    4   Great Crazy > Samson. Pre-drums is really well done. Slightly unusual setlist, and all the better for it; a decent show.
12-08-87    3.5 Nice end to set 2. Not as good as the previous night though. Energy good but more subdued than the spring. Standard 87.
13-08-87    3.5 All 3 of this run have been solid. He's Gone for a dead fan was heartfelt. Lacked in energy but made up in majesty.
15-08-87    4   Solid show and a good run post-drums. Another good Dew, seems common in this period. Another good set-list as well.
16-08-87    3.5 There's just a sense of fun in these shows that recent years have lacked. Good space here, and best ever encore screw up.
18-08-87    3   Promising setlist but the PITB was a bit lazy and nothing really gelled that strongly. Didn't do it for me.
20-08-87    3   Decent tunings, a long first set and a hit list of songs post drums are the ingredients, but this didn't no anything for me.
22-08-87    3.5 End of first set with Santana - laid back but not bad. Great HIAB, but after that died a bit. Still, Santana made it unique.
23-08-87    3.5 Again with Santana in the 1st set. Good looking setlist. Double encore. On paper looks great, but it could have been more.
07-09-87    3.5 First La Bamba since forever. Typical 87 show: energy is decent, playing is there but simply no real jams at all.
08-09-87    3   Unusual Fire on it's own. Show is mainly ok, suffers from a dip in energy after drums. Promised more that it delivered.
09-09-87    3   Brent opens with Hey Pocky Way. Devil with a blue dress? Nice mellow Playin'. Second set is really short, only an hour!
11-09-87    3.5 Shows seem to be getting a little shorter again. Mickey's birthday has a great setlist but falls over on the jams again.
12-09-87	4	Great first set. Second set was no slouch either. Another good Morning Dew, and a double encore to follow.
13-09-87	3.5	Super-rare cover of Fever. Good setlist for second set, but lacked energy until the end. Another version of La Bamba.
15-09-87    4	First set has equipment problems. Great Eyes in 2nd set - best for a long time. These shows are pretty decent.
16-09-87	4	Scarlet 2nd song in first set? Jerry goes wild in Wharf Rat. Excepting the "Blue Dress", another good 87 show.
18-09-87    4   Good Watchtower, Masterpiece and another GL > La Bamba > GL. More aggressive than usual Bird Song. Great Dew, solid.
19-09-87	4	Excellent pre-drums, but drums is better! Best drums that I ever recall. Really really badly cut into Maggies Farm.
20-09-87	3.5 Starts with 2 tuning riffs! High energy pre-drums but it lacks a bit post drums. Not at the heights of recent shows.
22-09-87	3	Spencer Davis guests for Good Lovin', adds little except for vocals. Pleasant enough but generally a weak show.
23-09-87	3.5 Had a good setlist but the shows seem to have calmed down a bit since the start of the month. High energy end to the show.
24-09-87	3.5	Jerry's voice is not so good. For a change Other One goes over 6 mins. Slight strange setlist but no major highlights.
02-10-87	3.5	Is LiG the best song for jamming in the first set? Maybe. Great Watchtower. Weird last song. Decent drums/space.
03-10-87	3.5	Really good Bird Song but the second set was more anonymous than recent shows. Lots of Adams Family tune-ups recently.
04-10-87	3	Pretty short, and largely anonymous. A mere 6 minutes for pre drums Eyes? Also, Good Golly Miss Molly is terrible.
06-11-87	3.5	Standards have slipped since earlier this year. This show is not bad, just lacks the unusual. Interesting Scarlet > Hell.
07-11-87	3.5	Overall a slighty better show than a few recent ones. Setlist was really good, could have had a bit more fire.
08-11-87	3	Another 9 minutes Other One, but this show mainly relies on too many short songs in the second set. A common 1987 trait.
14-11-87	3.5	Opens with a 13 minute Shakedown. Show is pretty short again compared to spring summer. Great Lovelight false ending.
15-11-87	3	November shows are patchy compared with earlier this year. So-so setlist and no real highlights, even with a Dew.
27-12-87	4	Awesome pre drums selection. Drops off a bit post drums but it's still worth a listen. Decent Quinn encore as well.
28-12-87	3	Has to the worst pre-drums selection for a time. First set and post drums saves it somewhat but not the best show.
30-12-87	3.5	Not a bad show for a pre new years. The Dew could have been better and the jams were short. Best was the first set LiG.
31-12-87	3	3rd set with the Nevilles. Rest sounds like a fairly normal show for the period, albeit with no major highlights.

13-02-88	3	First set ends with Loser? Seemed to be a bit of a warm-up for the start of the year. Short, strange post Good Lovin jam.
14-02-88	3	Fairly normal show. Space was quite nice. Recently setlists have become more predictable; also there is still a lack of jamming.
16-02-88	
17-02-88	3	Bog standard show showing the more mundane parts of 1987. Songs decent enough, but missing big energy and jamming.
16-03-88	4	Really solid first set. Decent Playing for the period. Pre-drums has jamming! Big improvement from the February shows.
17-03-88	3.5	First Fantasy > Hey Jude. Not as good as the previous night, but overall not bad and the Hey Jude was definitly a plus.
18-03-88	3.5	Fairly normal show for the period. The NFA at the end was probably the best for a while though, Jerry went off a little bit.
24-03-88	3	End of first set is nice, and a decent Half-Step to start the second. Rest of second set couldn't match it though.
26-03-88	3.5	Weird Stir It up in first set. Decent, very active, space. Pre-drums was mellow but not bad. Post drums more predictable.
27-03-88	4	Most bizarre start to a second set for a long long time. Eyes needs to move away from pre-drums. Nice surprises in this show.
28-03-88	3.5	Messy Stranger end. End of first set is much better (BS > Music). Second set is less surprising. NFA with no chant!
30-03-88	3.5	Second set setlist looks awesome on paper. Shakedown has lost an edge over the years. Decent Dew but skimped on jamming.
31-03-88	3.5	Consistent LiG quality recently. Strange exit from space. Post drums, longest song was 4:24! Major car crash in Watchtower.
03-04-88	4	Tunings are off the hook. Great To Lay Me Down. Nicely jammed Estimated. Best Other One for a while. Patchy in places.
04-04-88	3.5	Jerry's voice is bad due to a cold. Vocal jams out of LLR are getting boring. Good Stella Blue and high energy end.
05-04-88	4	Louie Louie from Brent. Best Smokestack Lightning ever, bar none. Decent from that point on, with a lot of energy.
07-04-88	3	Best Around x 2 - at end of first set - for years was still only average. Setlist looks good on paper kind of show.
08-04-88	3	Another decent setlist but Jerry has sounded out of sorts for the last few shows. Passable, space was pretty OK.
09-04-88	3	Unusual Big Boss Man opener. Hey Jude seems in place now. Another LLR pre-drums second set. Fairly ho-hum, like last night.
11-04-88	3.5	To Lay Me Down song of the tour. Decent first set. Jerry's voice better, and overall improvement from the previous week.
13-04-88	4	Interesting Sugar Mag / Playing duel sandwich show. Show definitly peaks in the white-hot Morning Dew. Reccomended.
14-04-88	3	Nice Bird Song at the end of the first set but nothing else about this show stood out. A bit by the numbers for my taste.
15-04-88	3	Scarlet > Fire to open the first set? Apart from that opener, there was nothing special. Post-drums was all short songs.
22-04-88	3.5	Like a lot of this run it is acceptable with no errors, but it needs something more - mainly in the jamming department.
23-04-88	3.5	There's some good setlists on this tour and it seems free of errors but the jam level seriously needs to up a notch.
24-04-88	3.5	Quality Bird Song at end of 1st set. Yet another LLR > Terrapin pre drums. Must say post-drums recently has got samey.
30-04-88	3.5	First LTGTR. Better pre-drums than recently. China > Rider and 3 song encore was a nice surprise. Again, almost no jamming.
01-05-88	3.5	Nice relaxed first set. Post-drums is yet another O1 > Wharf > TS > NFA. Needs some more variety in this spot.
17-06-88	3.5	Unusually, no SBD for this show. Decent space and pretty high energy post drums. Pity about the sound quality though.
19-06-88	3	These shows are getting really short on the jamming front. This rips through the songs with the exception of Bird Song.
20-06-88	3	First Blow Away? Shows are reminding me a bit of 1986, but with less setlist variation. Tiny tiny DS hint at end of Other One.
22-06-88	3.5	Unusually, no SBD. Sounds like Jerry doesn't know the new Brent song. Stella Blue major car crash; crushes the solo though.
23-06-88	3.5	Alpine SBD's this year have a slight chorus effect. Mellow first set. He's Gone > DS not a bad combo. Encore is funny.
25-06-88	3	First show with Hornsby. New songs and chatting are probably the highlight again. Tapes for this show are a little rough.
26-06-88	3	Again, no soundboard. Seems a bit low on energy, although Playing actually tries a jam. Post drums seems to be best nowadays.
28-06-88	3.5	Bit more open than recent shows. Estimated lacked bite. Almost a jam pre-drums. Good Stella Blue. Does summer 88 have any jams?
30-06-88	3	Believe It Or Not is not a great song. Kills a the mood a bit pre drums. Overall, nothing really bad but nothing exciting.
02-07-88	3.5	Super solid set-list for set 2. Short on jamming but pre-drums was fun. Too many gated drums this year. Not bad.
03-07-88	3.5	Short first set but ends with a killer Bird Song. IWTYH pre-drums, oh dear. Very weird second set ending, and NFA encore.
15-07-88	3	Another good Morning Dew to end the set but nothing much else stood out. Lovelight as stand-alone encore was unusual.
16-07-88	2.5	"I Will Take You Home" - post space! Very short, perfunctory Other One. Didn't really hang well together as a show.
17-07-88	3.5	Laid back first set. Pre-drums is the best part, although suffering from no jamming. Blackbird encore might be the highlight.
29-07-88	4	Decent first set ends with hot Deal. Unusual China > CF > Rider. Contender for best Playin' of the 80's. Post drums lacks though.
30-07-88	3	No decent SBD. Decent start to first set. Nothing hot, although the Smokestack out of space was rare for the period and decent.
31-07-88	4	Decent Bird Song ends ineresting first set. IWTYH - awful. Very unusual, good, mellow drums section. Post drums is excellent.
26-08-88	3	Didn't bring a lot to the table. A lot of these shows are very similar to each other, differentation seems to be in the energy.
28-08-88	3	First time in years there was a tiny hint of jam after Truckin'. Other than that, this show seems a bit tired and lackluster.
02-09-88	3	Let It Grow is again the start of set 1. Nice contrasts in drums / space. Some early MIDI? Lacks any real energy.
03-09-88	3.5	MIDI and a meltdown in the Bird Song! Electric Ripple as the second encore, unfortunatly the bits inbetween lacked.
05-09-88	3	Only aud for second set. No highlights, although setlist suggests one. Another Playin' reprise, no longer rare. So-So.
06-09-88	3.5	Nice choice of songs for the first set, but there was nothing really inventive in this show. Post drumrs is very regular.
08-09-88	3	Let It Grow threatens a breakdown. Rest was however a lot more standard, with nothing in particular standing out.
09-09-88	3	Both sets quite short (second set especially so). IWTYH out of space again. Very average, except for the Believe It Or Not.
11-09-88	3	Slightly unusual pre drums combination of Scarlet > Fire, apart from that nothing special. Lacking unpredictability, these shows.
12-09-88	3	These shows are really just washing over me a bit too much. They are not bad as much as lacking in variety. Hoping for better.
14-09-88	3	Lot's of minor errors in this show. Sounds like the band are unsure of themselves. Saved by the Dew and the encore at the end. 
15-09-88	3.5	Almost typical 1988 setlist, sublime to ridiculous (Playing paired with UJB seems common). Normal show, but pre drums was decent.
16-09-88	3.5	Not a bad show at all; energy from the start and throughout. Estimated > Terrapin > DS were the highlights, sans Bobby screams.
18-09-88	3.5	Good first set, and mainly decent up to drums. NFA chant to start second set. Post drums was OO > WR > TS > NFA again.
19-09-88	3.5	Another Playing reprise pre-drums - seems to be getting quite common. Could have with a pinch more energy but not too bad.
20-09-88	3	Another Morning Dew to end the show but not as epic as recent versions. Rare (now) JB Goode to end, but this show needed more.
22-09-88	3.5	Only 1980's song was Fantasy. Opens with a long Shakedown. Excellent TLMD. Post drums had some unsually placed mellow moments.
23-09-88	3	This MSG run goes on forever. Foolish into drums + keys jam. How many IWTYH must be endured? Fairly decent Other One though.
24-09-88	2.5	Suzanne Vega, Mick Taylor... Hall & Oates? Suzanne is probably the best. Jerry's voice is shot and this is cringeworthy at times.
30-09-88	3	Nothing really stands out in this short show. Setlist not too bad and Jerry's voice is better, but this is to "by the numbers".
01-10-88	3	Late 88 is worse than either the previous year of indeed the spring. Here post drums is the best of an overally average show.
02-10-88	3.5	Unusual spaces cropping up pre-drums make this a nice change but otherwise a fairly standard show. Messy Stones and a cut NFA.
14-10-88	3	Rare (by now) Saint Of Circumstance. Good setlist other than this, but again no real jamming. Another Hey Jude slow down finish.
15-10-88	2.5	Unusual openers - Music Never Stopped start for 1st set, Sat Night for 2nd. Otherwise, this seemed a pretty low energy show.
16-10-88	2.5	Bit of a clunker of a show. Ended with the least climatic Dew I've ever heard. Jerry himself didn't rate the band this tour.
18-10-88	3	Better than the last 2 shows. Encore with the Bangles (?). Was Bobby banging a bangle? Space was decent until IWTYH arrived.
20-10-88	3.5	Roughest tape I've heard for some time. First Built To Last. Nice Hey Jude outro with the crowd but the source was terrible.
21-10-88	3.5	Nice Jack Straw to end set one. Overall quite a "happy" show with Happy Birthday for Brent and a great Stella Blue.
09-12-88	3	Starts off OK then fades off on the energy level. Nice to have Jack-A-Row back but could have done with more energy.
10-12-88	3	Very average show with no real spark or energy, except maybe a little pick-up post drums. I think Jerry needs more energy.
11-12-88	3	Either the mix or something else is up in these shows - Jerry lacks bite. A bit more interesting post drums with the setlist.
28-12-88	4	Good out the gate. Is that just the high quality though? Great Bird Song. Great space and setlist. Where did this come from?
29-12-88	3.5	Brent playing well. Samson > Playing jam? Mostly par for the course but not a bad show for the regular show before new year.
31-12-88	3.5	First show with Clarence? Adds a lot but is a bit too busy. Very long drums. Dew winds to a standstill. Weird triple encore.

05-02-89	3.5	Drums > He's Gone > Miracle > Dew!? First SOTM and We Can Run (latter a bit messy). Nice Playin'. Nice show overall, nearly a 4.
06-02-89	3.5	Strange NFA > Sugaree start. Set 1 ends with Tennessee Jed! Quite a long Terrapin jam. Killer Stella Blue. Not bad.
07-02-89	3.5	Brent songs not too bad here. Victim has a car crash at the start. Space arrives with a bang. Nice setlists recently.
10-02-89	3.5	Tunings are ever more playful. Great LIG to finish first set. Fine Playin' jam. Another pretty decent show overall.
11-02-89	3.5	Seems like Jerry has a little less energy this evening. First set has a great Bird Song though. Long Estimated as well.
12-02-89	3.5	With Spencer Davis and Dylan for the 2nd set. Best Gimme Some Loving. Bizarre setlist, overall a pretty strange show.
27-03-89	3.5	Killer Half-Step opener. Fire is full of energy near the end. Maybe needs some more energy near the peaks. 1989 sounds good.
28-03-89	3.5	Started off hot. Second set could have more ups and downs - it was a bit too smooth - but hard to argue with. Decent.
30-03-89	4	Excellent Bird Song and great first set. He's Gone nearly 16 mins long. Even a decent Other One post drums. 89 has started well.
31-03-89	4	Brent offerred weed to play. Terrapin at over 16.5 minutes! Really good Morning Dew to finish the set. Even IWTYH was acceptable.
02-04-89	3.5	First set is nice, but the Shakedown that opens set 2 is better! High energy needs some better direction towards the end.
03-04-89	3.5	Very nice mixed up first set setlist. Blow Away was decent at start of second set. Not brilliant but still a decent show.
05-04-89	3.5	The "Blues" show! Unusual US Blues to end the first set. Nice comeback for China Doll. Well played in the main, lacking jams.
06-04-89	4	Jerry is a little low in the mix. Really decent Playin' jam in set 2. Stunning intro into Built To Last. Pretty good again.
08-04-89	3.5	Little Slipknot riff in space. Nothing really stand out in this show but the quality is all there. Good Blow Away as well.
09-04-89	3.5	This is the best tour of the 1980's so far. Even "average" shows like this have great little jams (here Estimated > UJB).
11-04-89	3	Lacked a bit of the class of recent shows, although not terrible as such. Crazy Fingers > Playin > Terrapin was not bad.
12-04-89	3.5	LiG at end of first set and a nice bluesy jam out of Truckin' were the highlight. Rest was a lot more average. Not bad.
13-04-89	3	This set, whilst not particularly bad in any obvious way, also didn't feature anything exciting. New songs need more jams.
15-04-89	3.5	Really slow Blow Away. Playing went fairly dissonant. Dew is nice as well, but the rest of show lacks a bit of spark.
16-04-89	3	Rare (now) Saint of Circumstance (not played well). Scarlet Fire was decent but otherwise this show fails to inspire.
17-04-89		First show with MIDI guitars (in space).
