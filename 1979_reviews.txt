Early Brent Shows, boards only

    Tape is a little hissy and the board a bit flat (comparing with the the '74 I have just listened to). It sounds a bit 80's already, even Jerry's voice is a bit out. It seems largely played at a similar speed throughout, with the slowdowns being on the Jerry ballads. Overall the sound is a slightly flat, there's more sonic space filled with the keys but the bass is less prominent. Not a bad show, lacks an obvious highlight. At least the Around & Around is double time at the end.

    Again, the sound is a little flat and maybe a gen or 2 old. Again it seems slightly stuck in way less gears than the early 70s stuff (although it has maybe more energy). The second set flows through quite nicely, but nothing that really stands out. At least the setlists are decent in this period, and Brent fits quite well and adds a nice sound, although he doesn't seem to be singing that much.

    Once it settles down, this board is the best so far, even with a little audience seemingly mixed in (this is the miller.fishmanj-repitch.78748 copy). It's a pretty decent first set. Slips into AUD for the second set unfortunatly; the first part of the show has some good Jerry songs in it though, especially the Peggy-O which is a good change in tempo.

    Only the second set in SBD, and even that manages a fairly hard cut in the Playin' to rejoin in the fist verse of Eyes. Also sounds a few gens down the line. in any case, it matches the show, which is a little workmanlike and lacks some sparkle. From here on, assume most shows have a much more fixed tempo than previous years. It's not that fixed, only in comparison with earlier years. I also why the boards are so sparse and not such great quality from this era?

    There exists audience VHS of a major portion of this show, maybe the earliest ever shot? Fairly decent SBD even if it wobbles a few times. Nice first set ending with high energy Passenger. Start of set 2 is a weird mix of songs but settles down when Terrapin starts and the quality continues to the end. Great join between Truckin' and Around & Around. Best Brent show so far, mainly because of the jam in the second set.

    Another decent SBD for a change. First what I would consider lengthy jam as well, 34 minutes of Shakedown > Playin' before drums, it's the best jam we've heard so far. First Althea and Lost Sailor at these shows don't do a lot for me - I'm already dreading the repetitive Sailor > Saints that are around the corner.

    The new songs are not quite gelled in yet, and the SBD is a little inconsistent in places but overall this is a fairly decent show, although lacking in highlights. The first Scarlet Fire > Estimated > Eyes and the Eyes is too fast really. Rocking end to a show to give it some pep, although the Aroundx2 is not as rocking as expected, despite the souble time.

    The SBD may lack the clarity of earlier years, but the cuts into audience are a magnitude worse! First set didn't really stand out for me. Jerry has sung "sleepy" summer home in Eyes twice now. Nice jam out of Eyes and drums has some uniqueness as well. Post drums not as exciting and the Aroundx2 double time has definitly slowed.

    Partial SBD of Terrapin onwards. Best SBD quality of the year so far. Great start with the Terrapin > Playin' but really fails to go much of anywhere from drums on, although is nice and high energy. Hard and rocking to finish the show seems the way to go in these shows.

    "I can tell the ACE of diamonds by the way she shines", unusual change. Audio unfortunatly contains good chunks of AUD spliced in. Estimated is good but again the Eyes that follows is a little too fast. Drums are definitly a highlight of this era, they are no longer the drum solos of the earlier years and are a big improvement. There another Aroundx2 ending. This time it starts too slow, but the double time is definitly there.

    Starts with one of those long Half Step > Franklins. Unusual out-of-tune Jerry in Uncle. Long Scarlet Fire only really surprises in the length. Another great drums really sets the scene, and it gets to the end in good style, a decent Wharf Rat and a well rocked ending to the show.

    Slightly messy first set, especially the Minglewood where Weir's singing seems all over the place. The second set is average I suppose, however this was the first show where Brent's keyboard playing impressed me to some degree. The sound drops out to a fairly rough audience near the end of the second set. Overall, not a stellar show.

    Re-review:
        This was highly rated by both my full list (4.5!) and my top 700 (B2!), so I decided to re-listen; there is indeed a 35+ minute Terrapin > Let It Grow and the latter fills 22:50 of that. The Terrapin is pretty relaxed through Lady With A Fan. The next section is has a great middle but the end is uninspired. The Let Is Grow is ripping before 5:00, eases off a little and goes into a great keys solo; Jerry's run after is much shorter before it starts to really jam out at the 12:00 mark. At 14:20 they have mostly left the song, by 15:30 they could easily turn into space. It lingers for a while before Jerry drags it back - 17:00, and Jerry continues to blitz fast runs through slow music until 18:00, it then starts to turn into volume pedal space wahs at 18:50. Despite the obviously coming drums, the space holds and builds to 21:20. Jerry is last off the stage, it's like they can't drag the man off! He's almost solo at the very end (22:30).
        Review updated.

    The board isn't the greatest and switches to an AUD occasionally; the band seem to flub a few things post-drums. Despite this, I would say it's not a bad show. The first China > Rider for some time at the start of the second set is decent, leading to a long He's Gone. Messy but good.

    Same source as the previous show, i.e. not great but also not terrible. There's nothing really wrong with this performance but I can't say I really remeber anything specific from the show. A bit pedestrian in general, although I suppose the pre-drums set 2 material has a good setlist on paper.

    What's up with Bobby's Minglewood Blues changes in this run? Is this the first Brent song in soundboard? Show also has the first "Don't Ease"; neither of these are real selling points! Not really an exciting show unfortunatly, there is however about 30 seconds of a Mind Left Body jam before Stella Blue. If only!

    Very dull sounding board to kick off with (first 2 songs are AUD only). First set passed by fairly anonomously. Second set has a great setlist, no real surprises and a few 10 minute songs but still very decent. It's just it lacks a real highlight, although the Pre-drums playing tries. In contrast, the ending crescendo on the ending reprise is magnificent.

    First set AUD only. However the SBD that we do have is better than others of the era; helped by the blistering Shakedown / Passenger that opens - the latter is a total rager. The rest of the set is a little more sedate, although it has plenty of energy through the end. It just can't compete with the start.

    Nice sound quality and a pretty hot first set that is decent from the opening song. Can't say I'm a big fan of the setlist in set 2, but the length of songs, decent jamming and sheer energy is great. Drums takes 63 minutes to arrive and that's just 4 songs! Even the Aroundx2 double time is decent.

    Starts with a crazy long Half-Step > Franklins which really dominates the first set. Second set is a story of two halves. Post drums has decent energy, and some long jams, whereas post drums feels more like a a sprint to the finish; not as good, and a hint of tiredness. Still, overall a very decent show.

    Great show from the very first tune and whilst it doesn't venture into brilliance it is well played with lots of energy and some decent exploration. Very unfortunatly, the sounnd quality takes a major nose dive post drums into a distance aud with indistinct singing. A full board would be great!

    This is a decent show, although the highlights are not obvious on examination of the setlist. Good start to the first set and a great Promised Land to end, just as it started to look a bit rough. Longest Scarlet > Fire ever roams a little too loose. From Terrapin onwards it's all good, especially Playin' and the closing trio post drums.
