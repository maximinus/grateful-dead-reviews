    Tape is a little hissy and the board a bit flat (comparing with the the '74 I have just listened to. It sounds a bit 80's already, even Jerry's voice is a bit out. It seems largely played at a similar speed throughout, with the slowdowns being on the Jerry ballads. Overall the sound is a slightly flat, there's more sonic space filled with the keys but the bass is less prominent. Not a bad show, lacks an obvious highlight. At least the Around & Around is double time at the end.

    Again, the sound is a little flat and maybe a gen or 2 old. Again it seems slightly stuck in way less gears than the early 70s stuff (although it has maybe more energy). The second set flows through quite nicely, but nothing that really stands out. At least the setlists are decent in this period, and Brent fits quite well and adds a nice sound, althoug he doesn;t seem to be singing that much.

    Once it settles down, this board is the best so far, even with a little audience seemingly mixed in (this is the miller.fishmanj-repitch.78748 copy). It's a pretty decent first set. Slips into AUD for the second set unfortunatly; the first part of the show has some good Jerry songs in it though, especially the Peggy-O which is a good change in tempo.

    Only the second set in SBD, and even that manages a fairly hard cut in the Playin' to rejoin in the fist verse of Eyes. Also sounds a few gens down the line. in any case, it matches the show, which is a little workmanlike and lacks some sparkle. From here on, assume most shows have a much more fixed tempo than previous years. It's not that fixed, only in comparison with earlier years. I also why the boards are so sparse and not such great quality from this era?

    There exists audience VHS of a major portion of this show, maybe the earliest ever shot? Fairly decent SBD those it wobbles a few times. Nice firstset ending with high energy Passenger. Start of set 2 is a weird mix of songs but settles down when Terrapin starts and the quality continues to the end. Great join between Truckin' and Around & Around. Best Brent show so far, mainly because of the jam in the second set.

    Another decent SBD for a change. First what I would consider lengthy jam as well, 34 minutes of Shakedown > Playin' before drums, it's the best jam we've heard so far. First Althea and Lost Sailor at these shows don't do a lot for me - I'm already dreading the repetitive Sailor > Saints that are around the corner.

    The new songs are not quite gelled in yet, and the SBD is a little inconsistent in places but overall this is a fairly decent show, although lacking in highlights. The fist Scarlet Fire > Estimated > Eyes and the Eyes is too fast really. Rocking end to a show to give it some pep, although the Aroundx2 is not as rocking as expected, despite the souble time.

    The SBD may lack the clarity of earlier years, but the cuts into audience are a magnitude worse! First set didn't really stand out for me. Jerry has sung "sleepy" summer home in Eyes twice now. Nice jam out of Eyes and drums has some uniqueness as well. Post drums not as exciting and the Aroundx2 double time has definitly slowed.

    Partial SBD of Terrapin onwards. Best SBD quality of the year so far. Great start with the Terrapin > Playin' but really fails to go much of anyware from drums on, although is nice and high energy. Hard and rocking to finish the show seems the way to go in these shows.

    "I can tell the ACE of diamonds by the way she shines", unusual change. Audio unfortunatly contains good chunks of AUD spliced in. Estimated is good but again the Eyes that follows is a little too fast. Drums are definitly a highlight of this era, they are no longer the drum solos of the earlier years and are a big improvement. There another Aroundx2 ending. This time is starts too slow, but the double time is definitly there.

    Starts with one of those long Half Step > Franklins. Unusual out-of-tune Jerry in Uncle. Long Scarlet Fire only really surprises in the length. Another great drums really sets the scene.
