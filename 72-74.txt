Reviews of all shows after Europe '72 through end of 1974.


17-06-72
	Let's start this journey with an aud, shall we? It's ok, at least better than the horrific audio that has the odd 2 or 3 second patch here or there. There's an interesting Stella Blue (the first) with loud organ; in fact despite there being no Pig songs, he's quite up in the mix when he plays. There's a decent Other One here that arrives from a Truckin' > Drums but the audio quality does it no favors. After a slow start it veers into a mini-Tiger and then seems content to punch the audience into submission before a quick final verse where it then goes straight into Ramble On Rose. Mini rock and roll set to end and then we are done.

	First set is a really bad audience. Unfortunate, since the Playin' in the middle (yes, not the end of the set) is pretty energetic. Everybody cheers the Donna squeal as well. Wonderful bliss when the soundboard finally kicks in though, although we do switch back to the audience enough times to make the experience uncomfortable. Show is largely average. There's a good jam in the Other One but it's not particularly long and isn't notably better than any other contemporary version. Jerry seems to save his energy for the jam with the Allmans at the end (or was this after the Allmans show?), which is the usual slightly ragged 2 chord vamp.

	Pristine board has a show that relaxs a lot more than the Euro 72 tour. Some of the songs feels undeveloped compared to later versions (Jack Straw, Stella Blue, Sugaree) but this to look at them in the wrong frame - they are fulfilling a different function here. Stella Blues needs another 10 years before Jerry is really ready for it, but you could hardly complain about this version. The tape shows Truckin' > Star, but the former comes to a stop even though Phil is pushing. Star shows a wonderful lightness before building to a non-spacey bubble. After verse 2 a small tiger. There's a whole damn 3rd set afterwards, but it lacks suprises. Really good show.

	There's a more relaxed vibe at these shows compared with Europe 72. Almost like they don't have to prove anything. A wonderful, meandering first set (I mean, it ends on Tennessee Jed!). Jeez, there's another immense jam in the Other One, and yet it feels so natural and unforced, like the band just slowly arrived at some place deep in the cosmic void from which the music springs. This is fairly short jam for the era though, and avoids feedback in the main. Slowly Jerry picks up the pace, we enter the real world again and they spring a slow ballad on us. True to 72 form, there's a NFA > GDTRFB > NFA to end, although it isn't really needed.

	For once, and maybe the first time since the pre-E72 shows, there is no big jam here. Wild, right? The first set is like recent ones, and still very good. They feel quite relaxed. Playing is another (!) good version, however we are still really waiting for a version that escapes beyond an energetic jam in D. On to set 2, which largly continues the same vibe (albeit with quite a bit of band talking). There's a kind of half-hearted jam sequence but it doesn't really work out; even the Dew near the end somehow fails to pop. Every song stands alone and none are allowed to really develop. Nowhere near the level of the previous nights show.

	There's a looseness and relaxed vibe to these shows. Slightly more laid back than earlier in the year, hard to say why, but I do like it. Here again the show is similar in songs selection and format to the others around it; a slow descent into some hyper-space jam and then 4 or 5 songs to bring us out. It is formulaic in some ways but hard to complain about. I like the new songs since E72 and the absence of Pigpen has actually allowed them to be a bit more mellow. There's a long jam in Other One, but it lacks a bit of space, although it has a uniqiue vamp in the middle. Feels a tiny bit forced. Massice cut in Sugar Magnolia.

	Another show where there's a long jam - this time in the Dark Star - which seems to lack a little something. Perhaps it's because they don't really go into any form of weirdness; it's a fairly restrained Star. The rest of the show is very similar to others of the same time frame, even down to the mini set after the main jam. One of the things I ma noting with this era is the lack of surprises outside the main jam. All the songs except what you might call the "nominated jam vehicles" almost never wander outside - there's a lack of songs that could break out beyond say 7 or 8 minutes, even if they are played exceptionally well.

	Another show with a fair amount of on-stage talking. The band certainly seem fired up. Jerry is on the wah evern before they start the Playin' jam. This one almost wanders from the main theme a little. Jerry plays some really fast runs in it, even for him. One thing I notice about these shows is there is no standard first set / second set. There is instead a massive jam typically halfway through the second part of the show. There has been very little weaving between songs and outside the jam numbers no surprises. I'm still waiting for an unexpected jam out of a song. This show has an Other One but again a little tame. Rest of show is again good, but lacks surprises.

	Audio on this is messed up at the start. Billy is mixed way too high and the other levels are all over the place. Once we hot the second set, things are a lot better. A good thing, because the Other One jam at this show is the best we've had a for a while. It does 2 things; firstly, it doesn't just appear quite out of nowhere and instead arrives from a He's Gone > Truckin' to get us in the mood, and then finally Stella Blue is is the traditional place. We even, to a large degree, avoid the mini first set afterwards. Pity the encore is in a worse audio than the bad first set, otherwise this would be a very decent show.

	Another show similar to the others. We are still waiting for a first set song other than Playin' to jam out, and the second set is still like a first set but with a 30 minute jam. This show is the first show where I "got" Dark Star; Jerry tries Morning Dew half-way through but gets chopped off by the rest of the band. It's goes into an El Paso that is marked as going back into spacem but really it meanders direct into a tuning. The Star is more of a long jam on Star rather than a reach into the cosmos; it disappoints slighty and that change to Dew could have been what worked. Nothing much needs to be said of the rest of the show, it's just as tight and hot as recent others.

	These shows are definitly missing Pigpen. The structure is on the whole too tight. A first set with an increasingly longer Playin', and then another first set with a 20-30 minute single song jam. A Lovelight or Good Lovin' would be a great add. This is much the same, except the front half of the main jam has a Truckin' > Drums intro, although the outro Stella Blue / El Paso / Ramble On is a questionable choice. As for the show? The Playin' is maybe one of the best so far, and long. Also, this Other One is likely the best since E72. It's long, meaty and with several different sections. Early part of NFA jam is a little weak.

	As per usual with a run of good shows, one after the other, it becomes hard to discern differences but easier to be a critic. Here the first set is as per usual. The Playin' jam is a bit more subdued. The main jam tonight is a 45 minute Star > Dew. There's a good section about 20 minutes into the Star but it doesn't fully stray into full meltdown. The Dew is great but if I'm honest I prefer the later Dews; here the first section is great but the buildup doesn't match later years. Still, a very hard section to be negtive about, it's classic GD. nAs per expectations, what follows is a little perfunctory, except that Sing Me Back Home is now properly sorted.

	There's immediatly something about this show that says quality. Maybe the Dave Picks sound quality, the set-list. Jerry seems at the top of his game in the slow ballads. There's another Phil solo - I make that the 2nd so far this year. This time it joins the end of a jammed out Truckin' into The Other One. Finally a jam between songs rather than just stuck in one! The jam is great as well. We even avoid the dreaded mini-set post jam. Overall this is a tight, well executed show that bodes very well for the future. We now just need a few more jam songs to work with.

	Another great show. The band are so chatty right now. Similar set list again, however in a good sign the jam starts in a He's Gone that flows into a long Other One. Yet another bass solo, this seems to be a feature of the Other One's right now, Phil spending a minute or 2 on his own before the big intro. The final 10 minutes of the jam are a crescendo of rising peaks that teeters on the edge of chaos before being pulled in at just the right moment by Weir, who then switches to an ascending chord run out of nowhere. Great stuff. Possible longest show of the year doesn't really need the extra, especially since the sound quality dips near the end.

	A setlist that could be seen to be "more of the same"; not a lot of diffrentiation around this time. However, the jams in the first set (Bird Song, Playin') are a bit longer. This is the first Playin' I recall where it really calms down a bit and almost tries to not be just a furious jam in the key of D. Long long Other One goes through many phases but nothing truly spectacular, however the jam is bookended by another jam and a ballad, which makes the pacing a lot better. Overall, kinda "average" for the time, however it's a rabbit hole of a show that could be your cup of tea.

	David Crosby sits in on 2 songs at this show. Which songs? Well, Dark Star > Jack Straw obviously! Let's skip that and look at the first set. There are enough new flavours in the mix (and some taken out, obviously) to make these differ from E72. I'd even say these sets have been getting a bit better recently; like the obilgatory Playin' they are starting to drift to more interesting territory, and a bit more laid back. Can't say I noticed Crosby on the meandering Star, which takes a little too long to get going but is worth checking out.

	First set with dodgy vocal monitors makes the band mellow out a bit. Sounds great, even though Bob is apologising / complaining about the sound for a good few songs. This time all the short songs are done before the jam; short for the time but 10 minutes into the Other One they have twisted it into a new song. Unfortunatly just as we get interesting, the song switches into an inferior audience (from a nice board) and finishes. The last 2 songs are pretty terrible quality. The crowd sound like they are having fun though. Shame, as this was looking to be an excellent show, the setlist is great, another 10 minutes on the jam and continuation of the board would have made this a killer.

	This is a fine show. There is a fantastic Star, so that is a clear highlight. But all around are great versions of songs, sometimes in weird places. Stella Blue as song 5? A Dew to open the second set? Playin' almost but not quite hitting the 20 minute mark? Longest He's Gone to date at over 15 minutes? Even Big River, of all songs, pushes the 5 minute mark. Well let's be a bit more real, there's the usual Ramble On / NFA stuff at the end of the show but we can let that slide after all that fun before!

	These Playin' are slowly getting better and better. They're a different space from the Stars and Other Ones, and although they have not gone totally left-field they are starting to get there, with some calm passages now they are nearly touching the 20 minute mark. At this show they start the main jam pretty late; A 38 minute Other One that has a song into and out of. The length has some validity, as the song snakes around quite a bit, although there's no true meltdown. Overall a decent show, but I think the setlist deceives somewhat.

	Hard to rate: audience only

21-09-72
	First set is not the usual excellence. They are almost universally very very good without being killer, a certain edge is still lacking with Pigpen gone. Second set is a bit all over the place until a very long Star (37 mins). It takes some time to get going but the last 7/8 minutes erupts into a rhythmic jam over some unheard chord structure (sounds a bit like the mind left body jam chords but never quite gets there). Even the ending of this show is a bit strange.

	It feels almost rude to complain about audio quality from a live show this old, but issues are noted because most shows are surprisingly good; this soundboard however has some phasing artifacts. An unusual Cryptical is played here but Jerry and the band seem a little unsure. Improves after that and I would say everything else is solid, but the main jam is short for the period and the end of the show lacks some fire and finesse. It's not a bad show by any means, it just doesn't stack up well against others of the same period.

	For me, the first Playin' that really comes alive, in the sense that it floats properly away from the default jam they've been grooving on since the start of the year. Greatest Story is majestically laid-back. Yeh, there are some sound issues, but this is a great show despite them. The tape crackles it's way through a terrific Star > China > Rider; there's a few rockers after but the band are done. A pity the tape is not in better condition, a slightly messy but great show.

	Another decent show in this run. It's however not really as hot as the previous one; the Playin' is a little too laid back, the main jam is a little short and there are no stand-outs in the rest of the show. This latter point is because pretty much all the songs are played very well consistently but you know where the jams are coming. The surprises really come in a change to the setlist; in this case the "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" that follows the main jam. Nicely done but cuts the jam short - I do respect them changing things up though.

	Opens with a Dew. Gotta be a good start, right? Kind of. Aprt from the change of pace at the start, the rest of set 1 and most of set 2 proceeds as normal. Once again the main jam pretty much stands alone. It's a 30 minute Star but it takes some time to really get anywhere and lacks a bit of bite. First verse is spectactularly late, meaning the last 5 or 6 minutes seperated from the main jam (maybe a meltdown if the verse had been missed). Not overally a bad show but the obvious highlights are a slight letdown. Even the Playin' only rises to 15 minutes.

	Show starts great. Begins to really take off in the Playin' jam. Greatest story has a fluffed note but we can forgive that as Jerry somehow squeezes in the St.Stephen intro riff for a touch of genius. Great jam that actually flows through a few songs with nary a missed note inbetween them all. Great show, decent setlist, sounds great, what else is needed?

30-09-72
	Weird board with very low Keith and Bobby mixed way up. Overall a very relaxed show. The Playin' is pretty relaxed and nothing really runs hot - an observation not a complaint! This vibe stands out in the Truckin' > Other One > Phil solo, the transitions are very smoothy and quite jazzy. Killer jam in the last half of the Other One. Unusually Phil is the one that brings us home. Overall a decent show, could have done with a touch more energy in some places and the end ran a little flat, made up for by the end of the main jam.

02-10-72
	This is another decent show, however it lacks highlights. Again the first set stuff is very good but nothing goes really out there, however the highlights of the show might be in the Bird Song and Playin'. The second set features what might be the most least jam-orientated second half post Europe 72. The Dew is good but needed to cook a bit longer at the end. The UJB is really nice, but too short. Bit of a mixed bag.

	Again, a first set of very well played but safe material. It really comes alive in the Playin', a very hot version indeed. After that, we get another show similar in tone to the previous onel a decent show a bit lower on jamming. The quality is very high when it hits but it's a bit too short and the end arrives a bit too quickly. Top marks for the bass solo though, even though it's unfortunatly cut up a little bit.

	Check out this setlist - the least jammed show since pre Europe 72? Perhaps the long Playin' sated their thirst. The setlist means I will skip this show for full review, except for the Playin' - it's a bit of an epic here.

18-10-72
	Very well played first set, everything good and laid back; however the degree of seperation between first sets in this era is very little and tends to depend on either minimal jamming or unusual setlist. This one is certainly unusual - it has the first ever Playin' sandwich! Also contains maybe the best Phil solo this year. Dew jams into a Playin reprise! What a great journey, although the songs around the Star were maybe the best part.

	Tape quality has downhill a bit. It's listenable but there's noticable tape hiss. Does improve somewhat as the show goes on. We are seeing some changes here. There is no Playin', for a start, and for the second time in a row we start the second set with a multi-song jam. The Other One here is one of the better ones for the year, which is really saying something for 1972. Show seems a little short for the period, maybe because of the set changes; still, definitly worth a good listen.

21-10-72
	The ever last free show. We only have a partial tape to go on, but it certainly contains the goods. The mix is a tad weird though, you can harldy hear Billy and Phil is right up. The bass is so loud at some points that my headphones couldn't handle it. The jam was pretty decent, although I have to say it felt a bit low energy at times. Sticks out most on the Dew - the higher tempo versions (where is builds to more a crescendo) are more my sort of thing.

	Too much of a bad audience to review.

24-10-72
	Another show where we are missing a decent chunk of music. What we have are the highlights though, including a fantastic Philo stomp. The main jam is once again split over many songs, which seems to be the band work now. It's a definite improvement and a good indicator of the future. A really good show, it's a pity that we don't have more of this.
