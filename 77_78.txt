	First Terrapin is a little fast and kept simple, but it's a good one with no mistakes. The Betty board is really good sound quality. Quite a different tone from a year before. Estimated is competent but not that exciting in it's inital trial. Sugaree is really when things settle down a bit. Nice breakdown in the Playin' at 8 minutes in. Very relaxed end to the set. Second set is very much one of 2 halves. A very nice Help > Slip > Franklins composes most of the first half; a weirdly placed Promised splits the 2 parts and we end with Eyes > Dancin' > Around. The overall feeling is of control, I'd say like a tightly directed 76 show. The first set has the better jam, a more interesting setlist and possibly the better songs. Never felt the band were really pushing it at any time. Starts to run out of steam near the end of the show.

	Starts with Loser, very unusual. Only avaliable source for much of the show is an AUD, but actually it's not bad for the era. First set has no obvious highlights and is a mostly fairly tame. The Music Never at the end kind dribbles to a close. Start of set 2 suffers from a similar fate; it's a bit flat, and the audience tape with it's limited dynamic range doesn't help. Second Terrapin is a little more relaxed than the previous night, still sounds like they are having to think about a lot though. Instant clarity as the SBD hits in at the end of Terrapin.

	Decent energy in the opening Promised Land, despite Bobby screwing up the start. Half Step has a ton of fluffed lyrics. Sugaree is laid back and decent. First Fire (and first Scarlet Fire) is a little low on energy but they get the basics. Estimated and Terrapin in the 2nd set now. The former is smooth but lacks any real excitement 0 they are still learning; the latter contains "At A Siding" but the band play it 100% straight befoer a slide into a very short drums. Sounds like a slightly different band after drums (perhaps all the stress of new songs has gone?) a long, decent NFA flows effortlessly into a St Stephen. Rocking end to the show is the highlight, despite all the new stuff earlier, and contains most of the high energy stuff.

	Fantatic set list - set 1 ends Estimated / Terrapin > PITB > Samson > PITB, lasting 50 minutes! The Estimated and Terrapin still sound like they are carefully learning. Neither have had any errors so far, but they've also been quite restrained. The Playin' is a good jam that goes a few places. Eyes kicks off the 2nd set, and some pace as well. It's only 60 minutes long but has a great sequence and except for Eyes being a little fast every song is well played. Bonus marks for the smooth transitions in the last few songs. Good rocking (but quite contained) ending and the UJB encore was pretty nice as well; I do wonder why the second set was only an hour though.

	Another first set with a bunch of jamming numbers (Estimated, Scarlet) at end of first set. Coupled with the Terrapin encore, it makes the setlist look a little uneven. Still, most of the first set is more normal stuff, although I'm not sure Deal should ever be in the middle of a set. Nothing really pops for me until Scarlet hits at the end of set 1 and the song portion suddenly has a load of energy. Crikes - even the following jam keeps it up! 2nd set starts well but the 14 min Row Jimmy (and long breaks between tunes) is a tap on the brakes. Even the 15m Other One spends half of it's time in noodly space. It sounds very like '76 to me. End of each set has the best stuff; however, this is the weakest 77 show so far, despite great SQ.

	You know it should be a good show when it starts with a dodgy Promised Land in terrible sound quality! Jerry muffs the vocals on Half-Step which leads to a great middle solo. Really well crafted first set, pretty much every song is a decent one with a stand-out Playin' to end. Best first set so far? Unsurprisingly the second set can't quite compete. Second ever Scarlet Fire doesn't flow as smoothly as it eventually will. Long gaps between songs and a slow Must Have Been The Roses kill the energy somewhat, and from this song onwards the show is a lot less interesting. Sure, there's a split Dancin' with a Mojo Workin' in the middle but played out it's not as good as it looks on paper. No encore - they close the 2nd set with a Terrapin. Keith has a Moog keyboard for this show but he sounds slightly out of tune during the Terrapin. Keep this show for the the 1st set.

	Setlist looks a little weak to me, but on with the show! Another good first set. One thing about this year so far - no duff songs. Even if the setlist doesn't excite (like this one) it doesn't mean I'm not enjoying the music. Energy is great in Scarlet at end of first set, leading to a mellow jam that peaks in the best Fire so far. Good end to the set - Jerry speaks as well! Like the previous night, the second set that follows is not as good as the first, which is true for most of these shows so far. It's not like they are bad, just lacking a good journey for the majority of the set. Here the Help > Slip is about 23 minutes, similar in length to the jam the previous night, and then we end with a bunch of rockers. Nothing to dislike, but I'm still waiting for a really decent decond set to appear

	This looks great on paper! It's a pity that the SQ isn't up to the quality of recent shows. Despite another Estimated, there are no real jams to be found in the first set. Most of the songs washed over me to be honest - although I think the lack of top end on the tape doesn't help. Second set and the quality dips significantly. Possibly the best overall Scarlet > Fire so far this year. The first Terrapin > Playin' pairing sees the band sounding very confident (although the volume drop at 6:35 in Terrapin is weird). The patch source for this SBD is terrible. It's a pity that all sources are sub-par since this might be the best second set of the year. Wharf Rat in particular is really good, the outro jam is possibly best ever for the song - and it fades out! Overall a great show ruined by a terrible source.

	AUD + SBD. SBD is not as good as contemporary shows. There's also a cut in Peggy-O and a big drop in SQ for set 2. SBD released on vinyl only.

	Worst source of the tour so far. This sounds like a decent show but due to the tape all the dynamics are lost, can barely hear Phil or Bobby and the audience noises make it hard to rate the true energy of this performance. This is especially true of the quieter passages. Let's talk positives though. Like the rest of the year, there are no fluffs, miscues or dodgy notes to annoy the listener. And we already mentioned how all the songs are good. There are still some pacing issues though - why, for example, is there a Samson in the middle of set 2 for this show? Overall, rating this show is very hard without a decent source, it seemed a decent enough show though. Can't say anything particularly stood out though.
	Setlist: 6 Energy: 6 Jamming: 5 Playing: 6
	AUD + VIDEO. Video is a much better source but only supplies 80% of the second set. AUD lacks Bob and Phil.

27-04-77
	Not sure what to make of this setlist, it's like 2 mini second sets I suppose. Again a Samson where you might have drums in future years. The tape quality for the FM is generally "not bad", except for massive audience bleed at the very start and end of songs. It's another decent quality first set although any jamming has shifted to the second set at this point in time - even Estimated finally moved! Nice Scarlet > Fire, although similar to previous. The clear highlight of the show though is the Terrapin > Dew. The Dew is the first of the year and leads to a rampant, fanning peak that hits all the right spots. If only the whole show was of this quality! Final note: audience bleed is rougher than you might think.

	We only have the Moore audience unfortunatly. So I entered with some trepidation but then the show opens with a hot Help > Slip > Frank that doesn't let up for 30+ minutes. Overall the SQ is reasonable, especially considering the timeframe. A thanks to the late Mr Moore, who could have simply just enjoyed the show - because this is not a bad one. It's major failing is the setlist, which has all the right ingredients but in a very strange order. But including the opener, Music Never Stopped, Sugaree and the Scarlet > GDTRFB are all worth hearing. The Around & Around contains a second double-time section which I believe is unique. Would be a great SBD release, but hard to really reccomend based on the current audio.

	Another Moore audience. did the guy ever get a night off? This time there is a SBD avaliable but not easily obtained as Download Series #1. Setlist looks inviting. However this first set has no real spark to me. It's well played and nothing stands out as bad but likewise nothing really popped out for me. Half-Step attempts to stretch out but mainly this is composed of short numbers. The second set seems to continue this vibe. The only long jam we get is inthe NFA but this descends into a minimal groove with Jerry noodling over the top - sounds too much like autopilot to me. The transition jam out of Stella Blue afterwards is a thing of beauty though, easily the best thing all night, the change into St. Stephen just sounds like every note is unbalanced and about to fail (Bobby even puts in a 1-2-3-4 which everyone seems to ignore). Nice Terrapin encore to end but they still don't know how to jam the song properly.

	The setlist is pretty strange (i.e., good) here, although it must be said the show is a bit short. The AUD starts with a Might As Well, even if it's a slighty messy start. I'll admit straight away that this is the worst audio source so far for the year, making the first set very hard to rate. The second set has a very good flow but is a bit low on energy for the most part, although well played throughout. As usual in this mood, the slow Jerry numbers are the highlight, and so it proves true here, with a great Comes A Time > Playin' Reprise. The first half of the second set can't hit the highpoints of the ending. Although this show lacks a bit of spark, it's the first to put a decent journey in the second set.
	Setlist: 8 Energy: 5 Jamming: 5 Playing: 7
	Whole show as AUD only (2 copies, both quite rough). Second set also as SBD.

03-05-77
	The AUD is decent for '77. Long decent first set has few surprises but ends with a great Music Never Stopped. There's one or bum notes which is unusual for the time period. Unfortunatly, at least for nmy tastes, the AUD tape lacks a touch of dynamic range and the finer points are somewhat obscured. First set vibes continue into the first half of the second set (it has to said the 1st/2nd set dynamic of later years has not fully gelled by this point). This show really has a problem with obtaining steam, in some ways it reminds me of the occasional 74 show where the build-up took so long the band were out of time at the end. It's the same here, as soon as we enter serious territory, we are practically at the end. Combined with the AUD source, this is probably one to avoid.

	Great setlist, although it looks like most of the fun sits in the second set. First set I would say is pretty average. Again there is nothing really wrong with the set, but it takes some time to get going and the ending Dancin' is likely the best tune overall. Scarlet > Fire and Terrapin are again decent but I still feel they haven't quite worked out the tunes fully as a band. Unlike some recent shows the second set is much better structured and the main occurs at the end of the show - a very solid Playin' > Comes A Time > Playin'. The opening is very subdued and winds along in a relaxed, dreamy way for the most part. Thie mood particularly suits the Comes A Time. A great way to end the show.

	AUD, SBD. SBD improves in set 2.

05-05-77
	As seems normal for the year so far, first set is longer than set 2, and set 2 is seemingly split into 2 parts. No real stand-out tunes in the first set, although it's all played very well. The second set though - it's not 2 parts, it's more like 3. A bit before the Scarlet > Fire, a bit afterwards and of course the Scarlet Fire itself. Still not a lot of variation in the latter. There's an Estimated that's a little longer than previous versions. Highlight of the show is maybe the St. Stephen > Sugar Mags. The sad truth is the show is a bit like those 71 shows that never seem to go anywhere as a show, even when the elements are so well-played!

	Finally a sensible second set - but let's start as usual with the first set; this one is particularly good, especially the Half-Step > Big River combo. Barely a note out of place throughout. Once again in the second set there aer some pacing issues. We open strong with Terrapin, but then Samson and FOTD after, shich somewhat upsets the flow. Once we hit Estimated there's a proper run to the end, the highlight being the post drums Wheel > Wharf Rat. Show ends on a high as Around & Around (slightly unusual ending) and US Blues are both belted out. Pretty decent thoughout excepting the start of set 2.

	Buckle up, it's the Dead's most famous show. Let's do the best bits first. There's not a single bad song in this show, although I don't think there are any best versions either, with possibly one exception, which we'll come to later. The first set is as expected (and like the rest of the year thus far), in that it's all very well done, practically note perfect. Whether that's good GD is a debate for another time. The second set is essentially 3 fairly stand-alone jams, each better than the last (ignoring the Estimated, which is much the same as contemporary versions). The Morning Dew to end though, that's a killer version and the highlight of the show.

09-05-77
	This looks like a fantastic set-list, and surely it's hard to argue with a show that starts with a Help > Slip? As usual, it is hard to critique; Jerry fluffs one single chord at 2:52 in Big River but that's all I heard. One could say that the band dynamic is a little too consistent - professional, even. Second set is well done and has a great structure, peaking with the Comes A Time. Overall in fact I'd say this set is better than the previous nights, although it's highlights can't really match that Dew. Good show.

11/5/77
	Not a lot to say about the first set, it's the same as the last 10 or so, very well done almost everywhere except lacking individuality in the songs. The onyl real song to not fit in yet is Deal, which took forever to mature. Sugaree at the end though is well worth checking out. Although stil in it's infancy, this was likely the best Estimated so far. It's a song still waiting for the band to work out what to do with it. Terrific jam out of Uncle Johns Band into space, leading into what is practically a Jerry solo transition jam into Wharf Rat. Good run to the end as well.

	Set 2 looks like a smoker on paper, but let's savour the first set before that. Unusual order in that there's a MNS to start and a Scarlet > Begonias but this might be the best first set since the monsters at the start of the year, even though it has a totally different, very relaxed, vibe. Highly reccomended. The second set is decent, but is tarnished with inferior audio. It dips first in drums (which are cut) and gets worse - much worse - in GDTRFB. This is unfortunate, because there is a very decent spacey jam in the Other One (which features another short solo Jerry jam) that is unusual for the period. Decent Stella Blue as well.

15/5/77
	First Passenger and Iko add some interest to tonights show. Second set looks messy and the longest jam is likely in the first set with the ending Dancing. In fact my hot take is that the best of the show is in the end of the first set and the start of the second, a decent Dancin' for the and a nice Estimated > Eyes for the latter. The Samson > Ship pairing simply slices the set in half, and then we get a fairly standard set of rockers to end (wit added Iko Iko). The only time the band goes really off the beaten track is the last 30 seconds of NFA, and that gets cut short pretty quick. Uncle John's isthe encore again, and to be honest this is a song better used in the main set. Decent energy though - it just needs a better structure.

17/5/77
	Shockingly good first set has fantastic groove and too many highlights to mention (but check half-step and LLR). Second set continues the great run and has a decent jam starting with Terrapin (although it could do with a touch more energy at times). Overall this is a really decent show. It sort of lacks any one, obvious killer moment and is instead pretty much note perfect from the start to the end, which is certainly rare amongst Dead shows! Overall the 1st set is better of the 2, but this is for sure a show you will want in your collection.

18/5/77
	Again the first set is a perfectly played but lacks a bit of spark. I suppose what I am looking for is the unknown, the unusual. Anyone who went to the show wouldn't be complaining. The same is definitly not true of the second set, which might be the best put together for some time. It's certainly a decent sequence. Eyes, really decent Other One and Stella Blue form a great run, and the energy is there when required, and dialled back when they need to. Really good overall show.

19/5/77
	Once the opening Promised Land has been dispensed of we jump straight to it with a mammoth version of Sugaree. Certainly the best of the year so far. The first continues in a great vein, some stage banter - it's top notch all the way, and they close with a near 20 minute Dancin'. These sets are better then earlier in the month. Once again the second set has a more obvious structure, and we can really see a transition away from 76. It's a little jarring to see most songs on the second set being nearly 10 minutes, but it's good sequence. Energy levels drop a bit after drums, but the first China Doll since '74 is a decent version.

21/5/77
	Well this *is* a killer show. The first set is great - practically every songs shines and only the newness of Passenger and the slowness of Row Jimmy give rise to the mildest of complaints. What follows has to be the best setlist of the May shows so far, and it's helped by essentially being a 1 hour plus focused jam. You even get to listen to the band putting it all together after BE Woman. Although drums in the middle of the second set is almost ubiquitous from 79 onwards, it does make for better sequences in this period. Encore is US Blues, usually (and this is no exception) a rager in the encore slots.

22/5/77
	I was a bit torn by the setlist, it looks like an amazing run and then I see that Terrapin is only 5 minutes long as they skip the entire Lady With A Fan part, the only ever time this was done. On the other hand - look at that setlist! It contains most of the greats of the time, and a great run at the end as well. First set, as always now, excellent. with a great Music / Sugaree to kick off with. There's a touch of Cornell here as both shows end with pretty epic Dews. This version is of a similar vein but overall this how is better. It might even be the best of 77 so far - overall this one is a real peach (even that Terrapin wasn't too bad!)

25/5/77
	Another decent set-list; these have definitly got better over the tour. This is laid-back show compared to recent ones, however it has a pretty sublime Other One based suite of songs in the second set that is very different. It's definitly a slightly different mood tonight and you can feel the band lay back a bit. No complaints though, as has been the case for most of the year, there are no mistakes, Jerry's voice is great and the whole ensemble are playing like clockwork. Perhaps that last point is my only realy complaint, this is maybe a touch too smooth for the band, and a atouch more chaos would maybe suit this otherwise relaxing show.
	Setlist: 7 Energy: 5 Jamming: 7 Playing: 8

26/5/77
	Another good first set, although not to the heights of recent shows (although they certainly do try - this would be killer in some other periods). It's best parts are the beginning and end, although the suggest it lacks a little in the middle might be to question the meaning of the word "lags". Second set is a different story - the band seemingly try to "go big": open Samson rages, High Time is excellent and even the Big River runs riot. The final journey starts a little timid with Terrapin > Estimated (neither of which have reached epic status yet), but there is a great Eyes > NFA one-two that really rocks out until calming down 10 minutes into the latter. Ending Aroundx2 a bit chaotic!

	Long commentary from Bob at start of show as Phil breaks a string, also manages to fit in a joke. Jerry's voice weak from the start. Nothing really grabbed in the 1st set. However there's a very nice floaty Playin' to start the 2nd. Really starts to break down around the 15 minute mark when Jerry drops out and a Keith + Bobby jam starts. Jerry re-appears and they begin a slow, powerful Estimated. Jam winds down to drums (2 songs and 35 minutes in). Decent Truckin' despite the singing being down a man - peaks on the second rise. Decent flow to the second set and I didn't really notice the lack of Jerry songs

Long first set is a bit chaotic and one of contrasts. Sugaree is the highlight, but then you get a Stranger that has length but goes nowhere at all. Climaxes with a rushed Promised Land. Audio is SBD for most of the first set, but the AUD, despite a little distortion, isn't too bad when you get used to it. Slow start to set 2, a short Playing > UJB into a long drums which is fairly decent. Post drums is a bunch of short numbers that become increasingly ragged as they go. A lot of ragged energy (reminds me a bit of a 87) but after the Sugaree nothing really catches fire.
