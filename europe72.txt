"The beginning and the end"

07-04-72	4.5	Sam Cutler sounds tired in intro. Decent first set with no stand-out. Joyfull, effortless playing. Ramble on Rose is in the wrong place.
				The jam this evening is a pretty mighty Other One split by El Paso, although the first half is the better. Playing was a touch short.
				Inspired Pip + Bobby duet singing at close of NFA. Rocking end, awesome start to the tour. The band sound confident, even slighty cocky
				at times. The Other One could have gone deeper and another minor jam would have been nice.

08-04-72	5	Cutler sounds more up for it. The band just power through set 1 like a knife through hot butter, a greatest hits collection of 70's GD.
				A jam in the obvious place, Playing, is also matched by small break-outs in both Good Lovin' and Truckin'. Everything leads up to the
				Star, which flows as if no effort is required. Stunning riff forms at the end of the song into a absolutly perfect Sugar Mag transition;
				but is the exit transition to Caution actually even better? Confidant, almost egotistic Dead; near perfect, I struggle to fault this.

11-04-72	4.5	Open tracks not as blistering as previous nights - could they be? Very minor BIODTL error shows how tight the band have been this tour.
				First set is very well done but has nothing unusual. Real excitement starts with the Good Lovin'. The main course tonight is a 50 minute
				Truckin > Other One. It takes some considerable time to get to a meltdown but it might be the best this tour so far. This is a really
				good show by any standard but is not as good as the previous nights. The Other One could maybe have gone a bit further out.

14-04-72	4	Copenhagen. Again it is all quality, but it is hard to distinguish best first sets since they sound similar (although all are very good).
				The Playin' in this first set is slightly more relaxed and exploratory than previous ones on the tour. It's a very long first set.
				Star wanders a little too much for it's first half. Wakes up more towards the end with a feeling groovy jam but doesn't gp as all out
				as I would have liked. The last 30 minutes suffers a little from too much Pig rapping. Suffers from being next to the previous shows.
