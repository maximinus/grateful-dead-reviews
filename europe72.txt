"The beginning and the end"

04-07-72	4.5	Sam Cutler sounds tired in intro. Decent first set with no stand-out. Joyfull, effortless playing. Ramble on Rose is in the wrong place.
				The jam this evening is a pretty mighty Other One split by El Paso, although the first half is the better. Playing was a touch short.
				Inspired Pip + Bobby duet singing at close of NFA. Rocking end, awesome start to the tour.
				The band sound confident, even slighty cocky at times. The Other One could have gone deeper and another minor jam would have been nice.
