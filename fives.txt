5 02-SEP-68 Great start into Star. Fine space. Betty Nelsons Organic Raspberry Farm!
5 15-FEB-69 Good development of the Dark Star, and feels almost like a full show.
5 27-FEB-69 The Live Dead Darkstar. Not the greatest Star ever but the rest of the show is also complete. Even the Lovelight is decent.
5 01-MAR-69 Absolutly crushing New Potato Caboose follows frantic Other One. Possibly more jammed in the first set, but set 2 is no slouch.
5 02-MAR-69 This is just as debauched as the previous night, and longer. The Caution explodes several times. Very minor cut at end.
5 05-JUN-69 Relaxed pacing, tunes, melodies... a nice show in admist the chaos.
5 07-JUL-69 First Dark Star to lose itself to some degree. Great show.
5 23-AUG-69 Best Dark Star so far, even the massive Lovelight was good. Solid show.
5 02-FEB-70 Only a fragment... but it's the perfect fragment!
5 13-FEB-70 Greatest Dark Star ever? Greatest final set ever? Possibly my favourite show.
5 19-SEP-70 Great gig and the 2nd best Star of the year so far. Also rare Darkness > China Cat jam.
5 20-SEP-70 Jerry on piano! Best acoustic set so far. Cutler intro again. Feedback jam!
5 26-AUG-71 This is like the longest first set ever. Bob sings the "Colorado Rain" verse in Rider. Totally killer killer jam in Other One.
5 15-NOV-71 The second part of Dark Star has the jam of the year. The second has a unique best-of-class jam out of NFA. Best show of the year.
5 08-APR-72 Cutler sounds more up for it. The band just power through set 1 like a hot knife through butter, a greatest hits collection of 70's GD.
5 07-MAY-72 This show has pretty much everything. Killer jams in Playin and Other One; 2nd set has a Star > Other One jam. The Other One goes deep.
5 11-MAY-72 6 mins into the first set and we are in space! 2nd set open with Dew. Long, LONG Star is entertaining throughout. Killer show all over.
5 26-MAY-72 Audience force NFA in first set. Longest Truckin jam so far is nearly 20 minutes. Best jam of the tour in a meandering Other One.
5 03-SEP-72 Bass solo again.
5 18-OCT-72 Perfect.
5 26-OCT-72 Long, glorious Playing goes many places. Only a Truckin > Star > Sugar Mag to follow! SQ a bit ropey.
5 28-OCT-72 Awesome Star -> End!
5 21-MAR-73 Insect space Star. Best Step-Back. First Weather Report test.
5 26-MAR-73 Sick. Jams everywhere in set 2. Post Eyes! Weather Report!
5 13-MAY-73 SQ mix is terrible. Show is awesome from Playin' onwards.
5 22-JUN-73 Awesome Truckin' > Other One.
5 24-JUN-73 Phil 'er up! Great Star > Eyes.
5 07-SEP-73 Step-Back awesome! Eyes of the year?
5 19-OCT-73 Star > MLB > Dew. Eyes > Stella encore!
5 21-OCT-73 Playin' and set 2 of awesome.
5 23-OCT-73 Sublime set 2. Fight stops encore!
5 25-OCT-73 Another crazy second set!
5 01-NOV-73 Partial. Great jamming.
5 02-DEC-73 Intense Playin' > MLB, super mellow after. Encore is Dew!
5 08-DEC-73 Severe OO meltdown into proto Seastones.
5 18-DEC-73 Ain't nobody who does what the Dead do!
5 24-FEB-74 Dark Star > Dew!
5 14-MAY-74 Let It Grow > Dark Star. Crisp sound, great jam. Pure Dead.
5 08-JUN-74 Awesome PITB - best so far?
5 16-JUN-74 Another mental PITB, and that's just the 1st set.
5 18-JUN-74 Pretty mental, best Let It Grow so far. Nearly 4.5.
5 20-JUN-74 These shows are crazy. WRS great, Eyes jam with Slipknot.
5 28-JUN-74 Best WRS ever, with MLB and Star jams.
5 04-AUG-74 Great Playin' and really good 2nd set.
5 05-AUG-74 Now THIS is what a Truckin' jam should be like!
5 06-AUG-74 Greatest first set so far, and Spanish Jam > Other One in 2nd
5 10-SEP-74 Awesome Star > Dew. Best Dew so far?
5 11-SEP-74 Most epic Seastones > Eyes combo.
5 16-OCT-74 This show has everything.
5 23-MAR-75 Up there with the best shows ever. Totally unique. Check out the radio announcer before the encore!
5 13-AUG-75 No particularly mad jam, except maybe the encore, but everything about this screams "class". First set is awesome.
5 26-FEB-77 Awesome first set. Just a great show really.
5 08-JUN-77 What a nice, tasty 77 show. Jam before NFA is great.
5 22-JAN-78 Cooking second set, even hotter after the close encounters jam. Best solo Jerry.
5 03-FEB-78 Great first set, awesome Music Never Stopped. The jewel is the 40 minute Eyes > Playin. Best post-retirement Playin'? Could be.
5 09-FEB-79 Dodgy aud with a lot of hiss. Long He's Gone leads to sublime jam > drums > space. Shakedown encore!
5 24-OCT-79 Already tired of "Easy To Love You". Good "Fire". Short but sweet Playin'. Short killer 2nd set.
5 09-OCT-89 This Dark Star is almost certainly the best, and possibly, the longest jam of the 80's to date. Fantastic DDHNM post drums.
5 20-SEP-90 A 30-minute monster Dark Star after drums? What a difference a year makes. Jammiest post drums since '74? Absolutly epic show.
5 28-DEC-91 Show is wrapped around a split Saturday Night. Really killer first set. Unique Playin > Same thing jam. Best 1991 show by far.
