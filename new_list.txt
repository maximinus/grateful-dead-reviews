10-11-20	     126
03-12-20		 212

02-10-80	D3	First set is a very high quality acoustic set, complete with band argument. Second set quality is a little
				ropey. Playin unusually fades and stops in third set. A little too low energy, the first set is terrific though.
12-05-74    D4	Below par for a 74 first set. Apparently it was super windy. Second set features a winding Other Jam but
				it ends on a Row Jimmy! Also a pretty short show for 1974. Classic year, but this is a little perfunctory.
21-12-68	C3-	Insane setlist, starts with Lovelight and then jams from there. The jams are not as wild as you would expect
				of 68'; a mellow Caution > Feedback is the highlight. Unfortunatly, tape is very hissy in the quiet sections.
12-12-70   	D3	First set is average 1970, albeit as a soundboard. The second set has a good setlist for the period, even if the actual
				songs in sequence are short. Pretty nice jamming at the end but lacks fire and exploration, and the jams are too short.
11-11-73	C2 	What a magnificent setlist. Opens mellow but with purpose. Interesting show overall that does have some good moments.
				However, I'd say the energy level felt a little low and a more robust conclusion to the show would have been better.
25-11-79 	C3+ Solid if low-key first set. Second set really starts to open up with the Other One pre-drums. Decent show and energy
				levels good but not a stunner. Best part is clearly the spacey late section of the Other One. Also, Phil shows up.
17-10-70    D5- This is not a great sounding tape at all. The Star is definitly a decent one, but hard to peer through the murk.
				Rest of show has some decent stuff, but is cut up and again the SQ is not decent (you can't hear Bobby at all).
10-09-91   	C3	Both Hornsy and Branford for the whole show. A bit busy at times because of this. First set is pretty good but no
				standouts. Second sets starts well, and a fair amount of jamming, although played a little safe. Tails off near the end.
22-06-74	B2	Really good Playin, though not into deep space territory. Set-list is decent and well constructed, although the second
				set jam is a little short. As 1974 goes, this is merely a very very good show, smooth, relaxed and confident throughout.
04-08-79	C2	First set very neat but needed more energy. Very slow Minglewood. Excellent Shakedown > Playin jam pre drums. Starts
				modestly and then starts to explode a little 15 mins into the Playin jam into almost feedback. Good Stella Blue as well.
29-04-71   	C4	Hard To Handle may be the best ever. Most of the show is first set numbers, the main event being the last version of
				Alligator. Although of high quality, this jam is particularly short. As a first set though, this show works really well.
11-07-81   	D4	Has a solid Truckin in the second set, unusual for this period. Rest of show (excepting the Sailor > Saint) is well done
				but lacks any real depth. Unfortunatly, majority of show is aud - luckily the best bits are sbd but the switch is annoying.
27-06-84	B4	Jerrys voice is not in great shape but that doesn't stop the show. Good first set throughout with a decent LIG to end.
				Second set starts with a decent Help > Slip. Decent Estimated solo. Pretty killer and rocking post drums, all of it.
26-10-72   	C2-	The Playin' wasn't as deep as I was expecting, although it is a very good one. Unfortunatly, the sound quality is a little
				dodgy, especially on Phil's bass, and there are a fair few cuts as well. If there was a decent SBD , it would be very good.
20-09-70	C3-	Absolutly no messing around in this near perfect 70's acoustic set. It even has Jerry on piano for one song! Unfortunatly
				the tape starts going south as soon as we hit a Caution > Feedback jam. First half of second set is more average.
19-05-77	C4	Really solid throughout, it has that classic 1977 vibe but unfortunatly the main jamming consists of 4 10 minute songs.
				They are all decent individually but you'd ideally like one of them to come alive and go somwehere. No encore.
10-05-72 	C2	Talking about the first set songs is superfluous on this tour. The meat is the Playing and Truckin > Other One jam.
				Could be seen as "classic E72" but the Other One is pretty special. Slightly ruined by the ugly "2nd set first set" end.
14-06-76	C4	Fundamentally feels like it's stuck in one vibe. Granted I like that vibe but some movement would be good. Pretty much
				all done decently except Around x 2. The standout by far is a 13 minute Slipknot - doesn't wander far but an unusual jam.
07-01-78	B4	Weirdly this is a solid show up until the long Dancin' jam, which kind of zones out for a long period. Same thing happens
				in pretty much both long jams. However, show as a whole is pretty decent. It's quite the rocker in parts.
09-10-89	A2	First set is merely decent, more of an apertif for the main second set. Unusual start to set 2. Energy level from Dark
				Star onwards is crazy. Fades a little post DDHNM. Hard pressed to find a more joyous second set. Best of the 80s?
09-05-79	D3	Crazy high energy Trucking for about 5 seconds that itself rides in from a He's Gone that improbably passes through
				a Masterpiece jam on it's way. Unfortunatly it's audience only but the tape is reasonable excepting some audience noise.
25-01-69	B2	Perhaps uniquely, TC is mixed quite loud in parts. Ihe mix is a little all over the place, but highlights the playing
				weirdly - it's more calm than most 69. The songs are a bit shorter but this helps the intensity. Short but very decent.
31-12-76	B3	Long, killer Playin' jam in the 77 style ends first set. Long 2nd set - the setlist ducks and swerves while still
				punching pretty hard for most songs. Dew is excellent. it just misses that touch of jamming depth lacking in 76 shows.
27-12-81	C4	Top notch 80s first set, even has a Christmas tuning. Killer Passenger. Energy wanes a little post drums but finishes on
				a good note. This show is what you expect for the period, excellent playing but lacking somewhat in adventure.
22-06-91	C3	This era is a little too busy for me, what with 2 keyboards and all the MIDI. Bruce keeps trying to insert Dark Star riffs,
				which is a little tiresome. decent Terrapin. Overall it's a pretty solid example of a decent show from the period.
16-11-70 	D4	Great quality for the year and comes with decent quests as well. Echoing what would come next year, the show fails to have
				a go at a decent jam. You get 10 minutes of the Other One near the end. The show is a great example of typical 70 though.
09-07-89	C3	Great opening and decent energy level. Setlist is not the greatest. However it's all pretty well done - even the NFA at
				the end of the show is a real rager. Also features a decent-for-the-era version of Truckin' to head into drums with.
02-09-78   	D3	Nice jam in second set starts with a 28 minute Scarlet > Fire. The former is a great version, but after that is all slowly
				descends to the typical late 70s heroin chic jam. Only one song after drums / space. Nice grooves but little exploration.
21-02-69	C2	Well jammed 69; not as furious as expected but still highly competent. The eleven might be the highlight, a 20 minute version
				that doesn't go into feedback when you might expect it to. Final song is a Dew that might be the best version of the 60's.
09-09-74 	D3	This is a show that needs a decent upgrade. The patches are rough. For 74, this lacks any real out there jams, although
				the vibe is good and the playing largely on form. However it lacks space and constant to and fro audio changes aren't good.
21-04-78	B3	Heck of a setlist. Pretty good difference between the slow and fast songs. First set is fairly playful and has a really
				decent Funiculi tuning. Killer Music Never Stopped. 2nd set has a decent story to tell in the jamming. Jerry smokes too much!
31-03-87	D4	Crikes, the energy coming off this first set is pretty crazy, and the Estimated jam isn't bad. It however lacks a bit of
				flow between songs, as well as a bit of length. Excellent party tape maybe, this era really lacks in jamming and space.
15-04-70	D3 	Pretty rocking Other One in the middle of a very decent 1970 show. I mean, the sound quality is pretty good, there are very
				few cuts and even the singing is largely decent.  Unfortunatly, it's merely "pretty good", and a little too short. 
28-12-90	D4	It's a good late 90's show but I didn't find it to be especially superior. It apparently has a mind left body jam but
				like a lot of later shows these thematic jams can be very hit and miss. Post drums lascked some excitement as well.
30-09-69   	D3-	Hot damn, it's an audience tape from 69, so we are already struggling. It's also only 35 minutes long. First China Cat
				Rider though. If this was a full show in good quality, it might have a been a ripper. Today, it is more of a "what if..."
19-06-91	E4	The post-drums song selection is quite a killer end to the show, but on it's own is not enough to raise this show to
				the heights you expect. At this late date, Jerry sounds strained and the music lacks some decent audio seperation.
18-09-70 	B2	You can discount almost the whole first set (missing), and half the second (terrible aud). However, it still has a
				killer acoustic Truckin, and a magnificent Dancing / Stephen / NFA / Good Lovin' jam. If only we had the full show!
10-02-79	B4	Very professional late 70s GD. Second set starts witha mellow yet fairly tight Scarlet > Fire. The setlist is very
				good, and iconic of the time. Solid from start to finish, although no jam goes really deep, despite early space trying.
23-04-77	B3+	Excellent quality audio. Very decent setlist that is both full of good songs and inventive. Jams are typical 77 but
				have an overall excellent groove to them. Reminds me a little of 76 with the mood and tempo but also has the 77 sound.
26-08-71	D2	For 71, this has a pretty incredible Other One. However, that's the only jam and there are about 20 other songs! Like
				many many 1971 shows this is more like an extended first set. So just go for the highlights on this tape, they're good.
05-11-70	C3-	For an 1970 audience tape this is acceptable, but it is still an old audience tape. Ned Lagins first show - you can't
				hear him - has a pretty	crazy setlist: Trucking > Other One > Star > Stephen. Would be an awesome show in decent quality.
08-05-81	C4	Nicely played show throughout where the standout is clearly the 30 minute Terrapin > Playin. Kesey on Harmonica adds
				excitement in drums space. Suffers a little from the show sounding largely the same pace wide from start to end.
11-09-73	C3	It's a horns show, but they mostly stay out of the way (when they do appear, it is mainly annoying). The show is pretty
				mellow, and that includes most of the Star excepting the ridiculous bass solo into Dew. Unfortunate cut to aud at end.
17-02-82	C4	This is a pretty solid show for the era, containg a decent setlist, a sprinkling of jamming and reasonable energy. It
				is blighted by that 80's "keep the same mode" feeling. Decent end to the second set keeps the fun going. Some mild cuts.
13-12-69	E3	A smidgen of hiss but the tape is decent. Very relaxed band here who aren't jamming. Some tuning issues at the start
				but it develops into what we would later call a good first set. Any jamming appears in the massive Lovelight.
22-03-73	B3	Well structured and played 73 show lacks a big jam and makes up for it with a slew of 15 minute ones. Pretty much
				everything is played well, as you expect, but it could with bringing a touch more to the table - non of the jams get deep.
09-11-73	C2	This show has some stunning moments but there is a lot of first set material to get through. It suffers a bit from
				start / stop paralysis. - it starts getting good and then is interrupted. Clearly the highlights are Playin' and Eyes.
27-08-72	A1	Kesey's Farm. Difficult to be objective. The video is the best GD video that exists, and I've held that opinion
				for the last 25 or so years. Pretty much everything is good, but I never listen to this as a show. Time to fix this?
07-10-77	D4	Great 77 show. Terrapin is slightly butchered and the whole first set is missing, but it's a decent passage from Playin'
				onwards. As expected from the period, there is no big jam - althougth Playin tries - but the energy and feel are good.
17-11-73	D3	The fame of this show sits on the PITB > UJB > Dew > UJB > PITB sandwich. However I have to say the first part was a jam
				that meandered a little too much and the UJB seemed to for want of a lack of imagination. Could have been so much more.
24-06-84	D5	Opening Dancin' is a little fun. Playing jam in set 2 is good for the year. However, Jerry's voice is totally shot and
				Bob's doesn't sound much better. When you add a few guitar flubs the package doesn't hold up with the other shows here.
28-06-76	D4	Show is not helped by a few lengthy aud cuts. It is has a slightly choppy setlist that teases potential jams. The Dancin'
				is decent and as a show it more or less works but overall lacks a bit of fizz and energy. Happiness is Drumming?
06-12-81	C4	Decent energy and really no duff versions at all. The space in particular is really good, but unfortunatly only lasts
				4 minutes. In earlier times a 10 minute jam could have been squeezed out of that. Slightly missed opportunity.
20-09-90	B2	This is pretty good. Jerry is all over the China > Rider. All the jamming is post drums across a split 30 minute Dark
				Star. The highlight is the second part of the Dark Star. Era is a bit busy but this is one of the last great Dead shows.
25-10-73	B2	This sure isn't messing around. Monster set list, and pretty much every song after Uncle in the secoind set is basically
				a jam. I don't quite feel like I went on the complete adventure though. On the other hand, everything was prefectly played.
17-10-94	D5	You can skip most of the starting 25 minute Eyes. After that it gets a bit more interesting. As ever for the era, Space
				is far too long ands the energy levels could be better, but overall it's not too bad. The encore is a glorious screw-up.
22-01-78	A2	The whole show is electric in the greatest sense. Even T.Jed and Row Jimmy in the first set are killer versions. Yet
				energy levels are raised for set 2. Best ever St Stephen? Only a 15 minutes NFA and a rocking duo to end the show. Phew!
25-10-79	B3	Second set opens with candidate for best Shakedown ever, surely. Estimated actually goes into space pre-drums. Short
				post drums is reasonable but fails to match the previous highlights. Unfortunatly first set is an aud only.
29-04-77	D3-	Only the Moore aud is avaliable. The opening Help > Slip is of interesting and might be the best part of the show.
				Second set had some interesting seques but the sub-par quality of the tape and general lack of space are negatives.
10-09-72	C2	Crosby sits in at the end of ther second set, including the whole 30 minute Dark Star! Sick Greatest Story. Surely
				the only Star > Jack Straw to exist? Not quite perfect with the flow but this show has more jamming than expected.
14-03-90	D3	Overall pretty decent 1990 show. First Loose Lucy for a while works the crowd. Main jam Playing > UJB > Playin gets a
				little spicy going into drums. Post drums the songs are a bit more choppy, but the energy level at least remains decent.
01-12-79	B4	Setlist really deceives, especially the CC Rider into drums. Whole is pretty good, the only obvious flaw is the Brent
				song. Rocking end as well. If there was a "typical" 1979 this might be it, Jamming and a decent first set? Not bad!
20-10-90	E4	Sounds like Bruce is trying to get Valley Road in after LIG. Decent first set overall. Second set isn't too bad and
				the Star is reasonable for such a late date. But it suffers from a lack of intention, and meanders a bit too much for me.
04-12-71	D3	Possibly has the best Smokestack ever done. Most of this is the usual "lets have a very long first set" of 1971, but
				it has a pretty decent Other One that spans 20 minutes and is entered into and left via 2 cowboy songs. Worth checking.
25-09-91	D4	That Would Be Something sure sounds like a MLB jam at the start. I might have preferred that. Another of those 90's
				shows where the songs in the 2nd set are all quite long. Jamming lacks a certain edge but still pretty good.
08-05-77	D2+	Very smooth and professional throughout, although lacking anything like a space jam. Dancin', Scarlet and NFA are
				all fairly long but the clear highlight is the scorching Morning Dew that has one of the best peaks in GD history.
26-07-94	E4	This show is pretty late in the day and has a Samba In the Rain! I must admit this is tricky to listen to. The overall
				sound is a bit thin and Jerry is turned down. It does however have a really good Estimated. The rest you can skip.
05-02-70	D4	Aud for bad quality fist 4 songs, then switches to a decent SBD. This is weird tape that has cuts and a strange
				set-list. There is some nice playing but it's short, and considering the era could be a lot meatier. An outlier tape.
20-02-82	E4	Another "meh" show. Yes the Playin is decent, and maybe contains the best Brent solo just before drums, but it
				lacks in energy and once we are into post-drums the song selection becomes a little lazy. More of an average show.
16-05-72	B3	Not quite as epic as some of the other Europe 72 shows, this still manages to highly entertain with a good Truckin >
				Other One jam, but that and the playing are a bit more by the numbers. Tons of energy in the rest of the gig though.
04-04-69	D3	Almost killer setlist but with 2 clunkers to start wither set with (set 2 starts with Lovelight!). Of the rest, the
				jams a little too short and not quite furious enough to make up for it. Best part is the closing sequence after Star.
24-06-73	C3	Although not the longest show of 73, this does take some time to warm up. Like 20 songs or so. The jam when it arrives
				is similar - it takes too long to get anywhere interesting, and the overall effect is a lack of energy. Well played though.
31-03-80	C4-	Audience only, although mostly acceptable. Sounds like the band really want to rock out. Unfortunatly the audience tape
				means you have to peer through a mild blur. Hard to rate, but would put this down as a decent 1980 show. Needs a SBD.
12-12-69   	D2	Very long show. Cut to the last 50 minutes for the good stuff: a great Alligator > Caution that hits the heights of
				69 jaming as you would expect. There's nearly 2 hours of first set 69 which can be very hit and miss to start.
04-06-77	B3-	Band sound a little far away with the AUD tape. In contrast, what a setlist! It's got almost every good song of the era.
				Adding to that, the jamming is mostly on point and it even contains a space. Could be show of the year as a SBD.

24-10-72	C2	Only part of the show is avaliable in decent quality, but it is the best part of the show. He's Gone jars slightly as
				it's wedged into a decent version of Other One. A decent Philo Stomp as well. Pity about the rest of the show.
07-12-79	B4	Good first set, great China Cat > Rider > Eyes, is then stopped dead in the water by Lost Sailor > Saint, the bane
				of so many decent second sets in the 80s. Aside from that mishap, this is a very solid show that has a rocking end to it.
05-08-74	B2	Dicks Picks 31, however the full show has some hiss. First set is super relaxed Dead at the top of their game. 2nd
				set has 45 minutes before hitting the jam. One of the few absolutly killer Truckin' jams of some length. Great show.
06-05-90	E5	Nothing really stands out in the 2nd set. First set had a decent Victim, which has a very tenuous link into Foolish
				Heart. Nothing inherently wrong with this show, it just doesn;t connect with me it must have done the first time round.
04-05-81	D4	Great pre-drums that all falls apart post drums as Bob tries to fit in a Lost Sailor > Saint. That's got to be the
				worst early 80s combo and first set-killer of the modern era. Still, the Playin' a the highlight and worth checking.
05-02-69	B3-	Short set showing up the skills of Iron Butterfly. Although the show starts with an Cryptical > Star, it doesn't get
				really going until Eleven > Cryptical, which crackles with fizz and energy. A little hiss, but a shame about the cuts.
04-02-79	C4	Reasonable audience tape has great second set pre-drums. Iko Iko after space kills the mood a bit; otherwise this is
				a decent look at the tail end of the Keith and Donna band. A decent Shakedown and Playin are the starts here.
08-11-85	C4	A bit fast and furious with jams kept short all over the place but the energy level was fairly decent and the song
				selection strong. Some 85 songs - Revolution / Satisfaction / She Belongs To Me - kept the show fresher than I recalled.
08-06-74	B1	Merely a very good show until Playing hits and everything kicks off. Unfortunatly there seem to be some tuning issues
				that stop the jam a couple of times and the very end of the show is in audience only. Still, they certainly go for it.
13-07-76	B3	Except for a slight lack of energy, this is pretty jammed first set. The Crazy Fingers might be the best ever, and
				LiG is also very decent. Weird split Sugar Mag in 2nd set. I'd say first set was better and had drums and more jamming!
21-02-91	C4	A little bit too much "jamming in the songs, not between them" for my liking but this is for sure an above average show
				given the date. Vince could ease up on playing the melody lines so loud all of the time, but it's a minor quibble.
31-12-77	D4	Slightly messy but the band are still good enough to hold it together. It's one of those new years you can tell the
				boys have been partying a little too much. Despite that, it's an enjoyable show just lacking something standout.
06-07-90	C4	Decent He's Gone jam. Maybe the best since the Bobby Sands one. Heck, even the first set is pretty decent. Tails
				off a bit pre-drums. Why did they ever keep on playing Around & Around after 1980 or so? Never a good set 2 closer.
21-06-87   	D5	Roaring with energy at the start, and mainly stays that way throughout the show. Playing pre drums is pretty short but
				quite respectable. Strangly placed speedy Masterpiece emerges after drums. Like a lot of the era, light on jams.
04-04-91	D4	Quite a decent first set. Second set isn't bad there are no jams between songs. Like other shows of the era, the
				keyboards are a bit over the top, both musically and in the mix, and I'm sure that leads to Jerry turning down sometimes.
14-02-69	D4	High intensity jamming from start to finish. I'll be honest it could with a rest at points because the whole thing
				practically shimmers with energy. If you know the era just looking at the setlist tells you all you need to know.
04-12-73	B2	Very short show for 73, especially the 2nd set. The Eyes jam has a stuning breakdown and feedback jam but because of
				time restrictions after starting very late, the band finish with a string of hgish-octane rockers. Still, worth checking.
08-06-90	D5	Contains a very nice and long Foolish Heart (in fact the whole of pre-drums is pretty decent). However it doesnt
				really hand too well as a show - a lot of the numbers stand alone and it's a bit uneven. Needed something joined-up.
24-09-72	B1	There are a few glitchy cuts here and there (the AUD patch is pretty rough) but this show manages to get over them.
				It gets started in Bird Song, raises the game in Playin' and then gets full meltdown in the Star. Really decent show.
20-03-91	C4	Set 2 really gets started well with a long and meaty Eyes to get us going. However, it dips a little after that and the
				next wave of excitement really comes in the classic Other One > Wharf Rat > Sugar Mags post drums. Pretty good for 91.
30-03-73	C2	Ignore the terrible quality first set AUD and get straight to the 2nd set. The meat of this show is the Truckin >
				Jam > Eyes. It is a solid jam of it's era - which means good - but it is a little short. Everything solidly played.
11-03-93	D4	The Ken Nordine word salad in space is great, although hard to say it's actually Grateful Dead on a pure level. As for
				the show, the first vset is better than you might imagine and Days Between is well done here. Overall, one for best of 93.
03-01-70	C4	Early and late show which I'll treat as 2 sets. The first is mellow and yet very well done. From the Dew opener to the
				Alligator end. Second set is not as good despite a 20 minute Other One. The sets should be swapped - listen to the first!
02-09-80	C4	Unfortunatly it's a not very good 80s board, and a few gens in as well I would imagine. Setlist is well done and although
				there are no major deep dives (hey, it's 1980!) this is a decent show with very good flow. Great end and rocking encore.
14-07-76	C3	This show has a strange setlist - or rather, a typical 76 setlist. It does suffer from some era issues where the songs
				are of similar length and the jamming is less wild, but overall is a very solid 76 show. Playing jam even goes spacey.
20-04-69	B2	Really exceptional Dark Star does most of the heavy lifting at this show. The rest of the show is more standard. Lovelight
				is the weakest link but for a change does not end the show. The sputnik jam from this show is one of the best I recall.
26-12-82	E5	Maybe I got excited about Phil's new bass sound because this show doesn't do a lot for me now. The pre-drums songs are
				fairly short and the Eyes actually has a screw-up at the start. First set is the highlight really but overall a bit so-so.
05-05-81	D3	For this period, the Truckin is really good at this show: over 10 minutes, has a Spanish jam hint and actually does some
				exploration.  Rocking end to the show as well as they belt out 3 rockers. Pre-drums wasn't too bad but not the highlight.
12-04-69	D3	Whilst nice to have another 69 Dark Star this show is a little too short for any real fun. Amazingly it is apparently 2
				shows - an early and a late - both of which have to end before midnight. Even the Lovelight is cut back on this one.	
11-01-78	B2	Really excellent Playing > Drums, even has a mini bass solo near the end. Whole show has that killer 77/78 vibe, but not
				as on autopilot as some shows. In fact the whole show doesn't really have a bad moment, the end NFA is a great little gem.
16-05-93	D4	I wouldn't say this is a killer show but for 1993 the second set is not too bad at all. Worst part is probably the way
				that Vince's volume seems to randomly dominate at times, and when it does he's just playing the melody. Good for 93.
07-11-71	D3	Dark Star is quite nice but very short. Phil attempts early on to go crazy but it never really heads in that direction.
				There is an Other One to follow, but it is unfortunatly cut short by a broken string. Rest of the show is far more normal.
29-06-73	C2	A good chuck of the show is missing, but we do get the heart - Truckin' > Other One > Dew. Typical for the era, the Truckin'
				lazily jam melts into Other One. The feedback meltdown that follows is pretty good. The Dew that follows is more subdued.
23-03-91	C4	The Playin' in this second set is really decent. Even better, the energy level continues for post drums, which is a little
				short but has most of everythinng you need. Vince is for sure a little loud in places, but this is otherwise a good show.
27-10-79	B3	I'm not always a fan of the lengthy 79 Franklins normally, but it fits here. Set 2 of this show does not contain any space,
				but the frentic energy and overall journey are very well done. Also Aroundx2 was still done properly in this time period.
31-08-81	C4-	Source on this show is not that great and really needs an improvement. Very early froggy Jerry. The Scarlet > fire lingers
				a little too long but the following Playin' is decent. Unfortunatly a Brent song after drums and ends with 3 rockers. Not bad.
16-09-72	C1	Great Dark Star. Technically is jams into Brokedown Palace but I swear there is a minor cut in the tape. A good portion of
				the show is either missing or of bad sound quality unfortunatly, but we get the sweet goods. Decent Playin' and Dew as well.
08-06-77	B3	Top rocking show from start to finish, one of the very best of 1977. It certainly doesn't lack jamming, perhaps it lacks a
				little space, or maybe it just needs more differential. It's like it's stuck in the same gear for a lot of the show.
06-06-70   	D3	Nice tight Alligator jam. That's the highlight, since the start of this show is essentially a first set, and the end is a
				Lovelight / NFA love-in of 45 minutes, so it suffers from the twin evils of 69 - ropey first sets and overlong Lovelights!
26-12-80	C3	Really decent Playing for this second set. It contains a very nice vibe throughout, and this early in the 80's Jerry's
				voice hasn't really changed much either. This has a 3 minute Around & Around - the earliest of all the short versions?
17-05-77	B3	It's May 1977, so what do you expect? A great setlist, with pretty much every song done well. The jams are not so fired
				up but they contain quite a bit of length. A fairly rare Sugar Magnolia for the encore, but only in audience quality.
27-09-80	D5-	The first set has great quality but it goes awry for the rest of the show, which might be the worst SBD I've ever heard.
				It does have a most unusual break-down / space before drums (not that good though), but the rest of the show is fairly normal.
10-05-69	C4-	This is not a great quality show. It has some weird digital artifacts. As far as the music goes, this is fairly standard
				fare for the period, although it lacks in pure crazy. The sound issues don't help, maming this hard to rate asd a show.
05-12-79	C3	An unusual jam in the long He's Gone > Other One, followed by some equally strange scat singing in the Black Peter post
				drums by Garcia. Can't say any of this was particularly hot, but it is a strange one from the era. Worth checking out.
12-10-84	D5	Very decent for 1984 - but I know that's maybe not words of praise. Still, the UJB is pretty decent and the setlist is
				encouraging. Songs a little rushed, and that includes the Morning Dew. Sound quality dips towards the end of the show.
17-01-70	C2	One of the last Elevens. This show starts with a normal 69 first set equivalent, nothing that special in there. The jam
				that follows is a normal Star > Stephen > Eleven > Lovelight, however the Lovelight is condensed and is actually a good one.
27-12-89	C3	Well played 89 show with a very decent setlist. Nice bit of Clarence Clemons as well, he knows when and when not to hold
				back (most of the time actually, he's quite subtle). This show is pretty good, mainly in pre-drums. Dew is a bit anti-climatic.
21-09-74	D2	SBD tape is almost entirely missing Weir. Makes is sound a lot more sparse. Typical 74 - laid back and spacey when they
				want to be. However the sets are uneven. Highlights at set ends: a jammy Eyes to end set one and a long Dew for set 2.
14-08-71	C4+	Killer soundboard quality for 1971. there's even an extended jam sequence, although each of it's members are fairly short.
				Otherwise this is just classic 1971 with it's myriad of shorter tunes. Best of the era maybe, but then the era is lacking.
31-10-91	D3	Kesey's rap is the best spoken word piece of any Grateful Dead performance. Killer. The music around it of lesser quality,
				although it stil has the classic GD sound even this late in the game. Gary Duncan adds guitar, not a bad fit on stage.
02-05-69	A2	An absolute explosion of an 11, maybe one of the best ever? Most of the short show is just one explosive song after another.
				Perhaps opening for Iron Butterfly drove them to new heights of energy. I haven't even mentioned the Star or Other One!
30-04-77	B3	A high-energy show pretty much from start to finish. The Stella Blue > St Stephen transition is one of the best of this or
				any other era. You could say there wasn't much jamming, but it still manages to wander a lonely path in a way. Good show.
26-03-87    B4	I would describe this as typical 87, but very well done (at least it avoids the lowlights of the first few 87 shows). Pretty
				high energy from start to finish, a crowd loving the show and  a total lack of space jamming. This is a real party show.
01-07-78	C3	Show is very much like condensed 78 show, as it consists of only 1 set at Wille Nelsons party. It's unfortunatly only an
				audience tape as well, although one of the better late 70's ones. Overall a well done show with no clear highlights.
24-05-69	D3	Mostly pretty decent from start to finish, although it lacks some of the more mad frenzy of similar shows from the start of
				the year. There is inherently a difficulty with rating these shows from this era, since they can be so similar to each other.
21-01-71	D3-	The sound quality of this show will unfortunatly mean it can't be included in the final top list, but it includes one of the
				longest songs in 71 - a 26 minute Other One that seques into Cosmic Charlie. Would really love to hear a SBD of this show.
26-02-77   	B3	One of the best first sets ever. It has more jamming and better songs than the second! The side effect of this is that the
				second set suffers quite a lot by comparison - mainly, the setlist disjointed like 76. Possibly best ever first show of the year?
12-02-69	B2	What a skull-crushing epic this is. There are some issues, for sure. It cuts in at the end of Dark Star, and there is a patch
				in the Alligator > Caution that could be better, but the rest is a torrent of electric jamming that showcases the era perfectly.
15-05-77	C3	Another very decent 77 show. It has a split-set quality to the second set but the whole thing is generally of a high quality,
				much as you would expect from the era (being a high quality board helps). Hard to pinpoint any standout song though.
06-12-73	C3	Mainly an excellent show with that beutiful relaxed 73/74 vibe. It has a 45 minute Dark Star but this seemed to lack a
				little bit of action for me. It takes 25 minutes to even get going! Despite that though, every other song is done very well.
22-11-68	??-	This show has it's merits (and even Phil Lesh thought it was good show all those years ago), but as a very early AUD, the
				sound quality is pretty bad. The setlist looks great as well. This was not fully reviewed due to the low quality of the tape.
16-06-90	C5	Interesting show for it's differences. First set is great, but then opens with LTGTR > Truckin' and closes with Sat Night.
				Second set has Jerry sit in for all of drums and space (and dragging the jamming out). Despite that, it lacks a killer moment.
26-06-74	B2	Relaxed and well jammed at every step. The China Cat has claims to be the best ever. Even the tune-ups are fun. The setlist
				shows a 30 minute Truckin but this is split with a bass solo, Other One and Spanish jam. Lacks a really deeo jam somwhere.
06-02-69	D3	Fast, furious, full of energy (and a few out of tune guitars), this short beast smokes from start to finish. Bad parts are
				slightly lackluster sound quality and the shortnedd of some of the tracks. Overall, a good pictire of the band in early 69.
14-02-70 	B2	The very first set is a Star > Stephen > 11 > Lovelight!This is a long show. Epic, even. What a crazy setlist for a show, which
				peaks at the very start and the very end. The feedback is one of the best done, very mellow and in fantastic quality. Killer.
25-04-77	B2-	Improved version of what I heard the first time round, although still not that good. The second set jam doesn't look much on
				paper but it peaks in what has to be one of the best Wharf Rats ever. The second set is generally excellent throughout.
31-07-74	A3	Very long show where everything is hot. Even Jerry warns people about additional weirdness at the end of set 2. Everything is
				relaxed and played well, leading to a killer end sequence. Perhaps needed a little more manic energy at time. Great show.
10-05-78	C4	This is not a bad show with all the usual good qualities of a decent 1978 show. The jam stutters a bit coming out of drums,
				which is a little too long, but in general it ticks all the right boxes without ever actually excelling in any of them. 
11-04-72 	B2	Typical Europe 72. Not exceptional, but typical from this tour is already better than most shows. Features an interesting
				Other One with a Feelin Groovy jam in it. Luckily, does not suffer from the 2nd set slowdown syndrome. Solid Euro 72 show.	
18-10-74	C2	There is a very long jam from the beginning of Seastones all the way to the end of Morning Dew that does some interesting
				things. The min-set that follows feels more tagged on. The jam is unsual but lacks a bit of energy in places. Good though.
13-12-78	C4	Well-played but ultimatly a little dissapointing second set. It looks great on paper, but only the Playin sections really
				cut through. Sound source is a board, although one with a few splices and generations, it seems. Decent but not excellent.
31-08-80	D3	Decent show with a weird end. Unfortunatly only an audience for the 1st set, but excitement is in the 2nd anyway. Although
				no song is long, there is a decent flow to this. Ends with 2 crazy rockers, and then a fan pulls Jerrys cables in the encore.


01-03-69	C1	What a setlist! What a show! Am I allowed to say the first set is a bit too crushing, and needs to relax a little? This
				show is definitly a good representation of the year, it's just a little overbalanced. The slow songs are realy good!
14-06-91	D5	Second set starts well with a Help > Slipknot and the set that follows looks very decent on paper. Ultimatly though, it's
				a bit of a tease with the Start being so short and a tempo and energy that stays too consistent. Not bad for the era though.
14-07-70	D4	A decent acoustic set from the early years. Crosby sits in but to be honest I couldn't hear him at all. Unfortunatly the
				second set is a bit too cut up but the Other One jam is certainly enjoyable. Not as obviously manic as the previous year.
05-09-82   	D5	9:30 start seems to make the band really full of energy to start with and then slowly wind down up to the end. Thus we start
				with a Playin jam! The first set is the best, rest of show is a lot more predictable. Sound mix is a bit strange in places.
30-11-79	C3	Greatest Story in the first set might be the best ever. Dancin' is also a hightlight, and the quality continues into the
				second set. A bit of a shock to the system to get Sailor > Saint post drums. Overall though a really decent set show.
08-11-70	- 	Too rough to rate.

28-12-78   4 Finally a crisp board. Lovelight riff at end of Eyes. Jerry tells Keith to be quiet. Killer Sugar Mag.
03-05-69   4 You can actually hear the organ on this show. High energy playing, although it's not the whole show.
23-03-75   5 Up there with the best shows ever. Totally unique. Check out the radio announcer before the encore!
08-04-72   5 Cutler sounds more up for it. The band just power through set 1 like a hot knife through butter, a greatest hits collection of 70's GD.
21-03-72   4 First Playing to really get out there (and nearly 10 minutes). Some lovely free-roaming jamming. Not quite spacey enough for me.
05-08-71   4 Mainly a lovely quality. Excellent early version of Sugaree. Other Onbe > wharf Rat is the stand out, again like a long first set.
24-05-72 4.5 For Rev. Gary Davis. These Other Ones are the highlight of the jamming vehicles on this tour. Another meaty half-hour here.
06-04-89   4 Jerry is a little low in the mix. Really decent Playin' jam in set 2. Stunning intro into Built To Last. Pretty good again.
10-07-90   4 Great Loser and killer Bird Song. Power cut in Promised Land! Great (and jammy) 2nd set. Space > Other One was particularly good.
23-01-70 4.5 Lovely pace and progression. Dark Stars getting even better.
26-05-77 4.5 Nearly a 4, but better than others around this time.
16-09-66   4 Alright, this sounds like a slightly different band. Is this date correct?
11-05-72   5 6 mins into the first set and we are in space! 2nd set open with Dew. Long, LONG Star is entertaining throughout. Killer show all over.
20-11-78 4.5 Bobby was sick, misses a lot of the show. Cuts aplenty. Craziest set opener since the 60's?
17-05-74 4.5 Needs more review, but still, what a show.
14-09-74   4 Some fluffs mixed with nice jamming.
05-10-94   4 This show contains a decent first set, a wide awake Jerry, a serious jam in UJB and drums with Jerry. What a great show for 94!
18-03-77   4 Low energy or very laid back? Only Terrapin flyer. From the sublime to the ridiculous at the end.
26-10-71 4.5 The first set is so long that they have to cut the second set short. Still, it features another killer Other One. Rocking end.
28-07-82   4 Agonising St Stephen hint after drums. Decent Phil-led Other One as well. Not quite as good as last night.
13-05-73   5 SQ mix is terrible. Show is awesome from Playin' onwards.
13-12-80 4.5 Nice solid show. Great Scarlet, Playing jam was long for 1980 and Black Peter was good also.
30-03-89   4 Excellent Bird Song and great first set. He's Gone nearly 16 mins long. Even a decent Other One post drums. 89 has started well.
26-06-93   4 Nothing special until the Playin' jam, which is another decent one. Jam keeps going in Terrapin! Less exciting post drums.
18-09-90   4 Ripping opening. Best Picasso Moon to date. Jerry and Bruce led jam out of Foolish nearly hits Other One. Pretty good.
03-07-69   4 Short and a stange list but very unusually for 69 the really slow songs are clearly the best. Great High Time.
22-06-76   4 FOTM jam in Playin' led by Phil. Laid back with seemingly 2 mini second sets.
24-08-72 4.5 Another great Dark Star.
21-10-83   4 Great pre-drums continues into unique Bob + Jerry mellow guitar-off in space. First chorus for Bob? Decent.
04-12-79   4 First interesting jam out of Franklins. Great Stella Blue (as always, it seems). Not bad.
15-09-90   4 2 keyboards? Not sure if it works for me. This is a fairly high energy show, the setlist was decent and the jamming was alright.
28-09-76   4 Nice first set, and second set not too shabby either.
06-11-77   4 Killer Truckin' is the stand-out.
21-05-77 4.5 Very slick show. Not a bad number throughout. Just lacks a bit of space at the end.
12-01-79   4 Continuing the auds. Has a super-long Dancin' but it didn't grab as much as it could.
09-12-79   4 7 shows pre drums in 2nd set! Weird Playin' jam out of Saint. Very up and down, but above average.
31-12-90 4.5 Set list screams awesome. Decent first set with expected jammy Bird Song. Second set is one long party. Best New Years for a while.
10-07-89   4 Needs a longer jam in there somewhere (although UJB was 12 mins+) but hard to argue against the overall quality of this.
02-09-68   5 Great start into Star. Fine space. Betty Nelsons Organic Raspberry Farm!
28-10-72   5 Awesome Star -> End!
19-11-72 4.5 Needs more review.
15-05-78   4 Tough. Hate to keep giving these 4, but that's what it is. Nice UJB encore made a change.
28-05-77   4 Back to the standard 1977! Setlists are becoming modern.
04-02-69   4 Nice jamming, although Jerry complains a bit.
23-02-92   4 First versions of Way To Go Home (needs more pep) and Corrina. Great Playin > Terrapin leads to jungle drums. Mix was a bit so-so.
12-07-90 4.5 Long Star but it lacks a freakout session. Drums / space is excellent and the end is rocking. Definitly worth a listen.
23-01-68   4 Horrible cut, nice sound, nice jams.
31-10-85   4 Opens with Space > Werewolves! Short, but probably the best second set of 1985 so far. 2nd set has a great setlist.
12-04-70   4 Another great Viola Lee to end the show.
16-11-78   4 Worst audience for a while. Band weird from drums onward. Best Truckin' of 78? Nearly 4.5.
02-11-69   4 Nice Dark Star, rest needs a little more fire.
28-03-69 4.5 Great Dark Star, rest a little rushed.
31-03-89   4 Brent offered weed to play. Terrapin at over 16.5 minutes! Really good Morning Dew to finish the set. Even IWTYH was acceptable.
28-12-69   4 No massive jams, but its punchy sound and great dialogue make this worth it.
23-06-93 4.5 Stunning, aggressive Terrapin jam into drums. Dark Star after drums is more like an appertif. Hunter's birthday, apparently.
07-08-82 4.5 Who is Phil Ruth? Grabs from the start. Mad drums. Proper space. Excellent all-round show.
21-10-71   4 SQ is awesome. PITB is short but it's not messing about now. Star short and sweet. Keith a bit too loud in the mix. Decent show.
24-03-87   4 Energy from the off. Not a fan of these Healy ultra-mixes. High energy Terrapin. Great intro to Fantasy. A good show!
25-03-93   4 Cracking Dew tops a pretty decent second set. Maybe too many new numbers (Way to go Home after space)? but a decent show overall.
21-10-73   5 Playin' and set 2 of awesome.
29-10-73   4 Good. Eyes in first set? Strange set-list
29-10-77 4.5 Best Let It Grow since '74. Space in second set!
31-07-88   4 Decent Bird Song ends ineresting first set. IWTYH - awful. Very unusual, good, mellow drums section. Post drums is excellent.
22-10-71 4.5 Again has that 71 vibe of a really long first set, but everything is really well done. Then they slap a 30 minute Other One down!
02-02-70   5 Only a fragment... but it's the perfect fragment!
24-06-76   4 Pretty upbeat for June 76. Great quality 2nd set. Short but not shabby at all.
01-04-90   4 Even better first set than last night, killer ending. This time post drums is better than pre, with a great Stella Blue.
09-05-77   4 Almost 4.5, very smooth as well.
20-10-67   4 Recording sessions. Hissy, but well worth it. First Cryptical.

3 Years Done

21-08-69   4 Quite mellow, and an improvement. With added flute on some tracks.
19-05-74   4 Can't remember anything bad, but no major stand-outs.
10-10-76 4.5 I'd venture to say that was actually a good show!
26-09-72 4.5 Truckin' of the year, excellent transition.
23-06-90   4 Another robust pre-drums jam fest. Great Drums and space, also full of energy. I'm getting used to regularly having good shows.
26-05-93   4 Solid opener. Finally a long meaty jam - likely the best Playing since 1988 or so, and almost on a par with 73 versions.
06-12-92   4 Here Comes Sunshine opener. Actually a decent first set for a change. Messy Samson. Good Playin' Reprise. Loud Weir but decent.
24-01-69   4 Comes with mad audience drumming chants. Also ends with drums...?
30-10-91   4 Pretty decent Eyes > Estimated > Terrapin before drums. The rest of the show is not bad, just not as good as pre-drums.
29-09-69   4 Another hissy aud, but it does contain "The Seven". You can also hear Weir on a 69 aud, which is maybe even more unusual.
30-09-72 4.5 Monster show, some cuts, good energy.
06-04-82   4 Call-response in Shakedown. Any show of this era with a Dew is normally good, despite a Truckin' whistle.
17-11-72   4 Lost in second set...
08-04-78   4 Slightly better. But these shows are starting to sound very familiar. More close encounters.
21-10-72 4.5 Incomplete, but solid fragments. Massive Phil.
18-11-78 4.5 At last a decent soundboard. Monster He's Gone > Other One. Best Other One since 1974.
05-11-77 4.5 Monster Half-Step as 2nd song. 2nd set starts Bass solo > jammy Step back > Eyes. Eases later but still a really solif show.
26-12-69   4 Billy misses first set. First acoustic set? Strange, but Star saves the day!
31-01-78   4 Good, don't know whether they are starting to sound a bit samey though. Another space.
16-07-70 4.5 Janis Joplin sits in on Lovelight. What more do you need to know? Also a SBD.
10-01-79 4.5 First East coast Dark star for a while. Good show; Star better than 31-12-78.
06-05-78   4 Awesome LLR and Deal in first set. Teddy Bears picnic riff before Terrapin. Better than average for 78.
16-05-81 4.5 Spanish jam is short but very good. Second set is better than the first, and a great UJB encore.
04-05-80   4 Good setlist, with nice little Playing jam. 1980 seems repetitive but this is just about a 4.
30-08-70   4 Cracking Easy Wind on this short TV show. Worth watching.
27-12-91   4 First set ends nicely. Terrapin jam pre-drums was decent. Best drums of the 90s? They really stand out. Pity about Around x 2.
03-03-71   4 Pigpen's organ is very loud in places. However the sound stabalises and gets a lot better. Decent jamming, final few songs so-so.
19-07-89   4 Rocking Deal and great first set. This run is a bit of tease with no major jams. Pretty glorious run overall though.
27-12-90   4 Only an aud for the first set. Long Scarlet Fire. Stunning Estimated end jam. Hamza in drums. Messy last 2 songs though.
12-09-87   4 Great first set. Second set was no slouch either. Another good Morning Dew, and a double encore to follow.
28-08-81   4 Best Wheel ever? No flow though - highlights quite segmented. Spanish jam after drums.
22-05-77 4.5 Terrapin missing first section, pretty unique but doesn't work for me. Awesome Morning Dew at end.
24-10-71   4 Another "1971 first set", but they are really well played. Decent Star but it's literally the only jam. St.Stephen's now short.
18-05-77   4 Seems 4 is a bit common. I enjoyed the show though.
14-11-73   4 Solid...but not as good as others.
28-12-88   4 Good out the gate. Is that just the high quality though? Great Bird Song. Great space and setlist. Where did this come from?
18-03-71   4 Come for the 2 mini-jams in the second set (with the final ever feedback). Well done but repeats a lot of songs from recent gigs.
28-02-69   5 This has to have like every single major jam of the era in the massive setlist. A nearly 2 hour explosion of jamming in the 2nd set.
15-06-90   4 Great Help > Slipknot to open. Really long show for the era. Around & Around doesn't want to end. Come for the energy, not the jams.
15-06-66 4.5 "Live at Various". Great quality from the Dead Hour. They even sound like a good band!
29-03-90 4.5 The Branford show. Eyes is great. Amazingly, once in Star, he holds them back if anything. A very, very good one trick pony.
24-03-90   4 Great 2nd set pre-drums comes complete with a full Mind Left Body jam which along, with the rest of pre-drums, is the highlight.
14-01-78 4.5 Hissy SBD. But has a great tiger almost into feedback territory.
12-11-71   4 Other One is already going places 4 minutes in. Great jam in Big Railroad Blues (!). Rest of show is a lot more normal 71 fare.
04-05-72   4 Great Dark Star split jam but the appearence of a mini-second set at the end again doesn.t really work. First set is again very good,
24-03-81   4 Sound quality just so-so, but a nice mellow jam in He's Gone. Screw up in encore - Jerry says sorry.
07-03-81   4 Killer first set with 17min+ Bird Song. Interesting 2nd set jam. Energy dies away a bit after drums.
25-05-72 4.5 Excellent double punch Good Lovin / Playin' in first set. Dark Star is decent but as a show doesn't gel as well as previous night.
30-10-73 4.5 No complaints. Needs more review..
21-04-69   4 First set too many short songs, and DS did not stand out. Otherwise good.
08-05-80 4.5 Best Eyes pace for a long while. Decent 'modern' UJB. Drums > Space very on point.
10-03-93   4 Good versions of 3 new songs into drums. Decent Mind Left Body into drums. Drums onward is relaxed but totally in control.
27-02-69   5 The Live Dead Darkstar. Not the greatest Star ever but the rest of the show is also complete. Even the Lovelight is decent.
12-03-66   4 Probably wrong data, maybe December? Still, it's 3 complete songs. Nice quality and it's on point.
10-06-73 4.5 Dew opener! Great Eyes. With Allmans, so-so.
18-07-90   4 Awesome setlist. Laughing jam in drums / space. Pretty decent Other One > Dew combo at end of second set make this one stand out.
19-07-94   4 Decent first set with some energy. PITB is quite clearly the jam of the year so far. Lacks energy after drums, but decent enough.
06-09-79   4 Mind Left Body hint after NFA! Better than the previous 2 nights and good from Terrapin onwards.
23-11-79   4 Rare High Time. Great Music > Sugaree to start set 2. A bit up, a bit down, but more up than down.
21-08-68   4 Very clear Phil. Nice sound. Pigpen bits drag on. Jams are good.
12-12-78 4.5 This is a very smooth show that I enjoyed, it was very relaxed and reminded me of 74 second set ends.
06-01-78   4 Phil breaks a string. Jerry's voice pretty bad. All Bob songs in 2nd set. Fiery end.
28-11-80   4 Less Go To Heaven material is better. Nice Let It Grow > Terrapin jam, mainly mellow throughout.
18-07-89   4 High energy first set. Crazy smooth Sugar Mag > Scarlet transition. Tour is screaming for a major jam. Fiery post drums.
28-04-71 4.5 High energy set. Band sound like they are having fun. TC drops in for half a set. Dew, Star, Other One, St Stephen in the same set?
29-12-69   4 Jams appearing in some new songs straight out the box. Wildly different from early '69.
10-12-89   4 Car crash rescue in HIAB! Monster Victim. CC Rider with Spencer Davis. China-Rider and space both good. Best Stella Blue for a while.
23-06-74   4 Nice Spanish jam, but a bit short on jamming.
19-10-73   5 Star > MLB > Dew. Eyes > Stella encore!
22-10-67   4 Morning Dew start! Such a difference from a year ago.
17-04-72   4 Tivoli. Good chunk of the first set was filmed. First set doesn't quite flow as well as recent shows, although it's hard to really
10-11-85   4 Excellent Stranger to end the first set. High energy pre-drums. Short on adventure but put together well as a whole.
04-05-77   4 Jerry out of tune at start. Get this for the dreamy Playin' jam at the end of the 2nd set.
22-02-73 4.5 Great PITB, very solid. Almost a great.

4 Years Done

24-04-78   4 Monkey drums and space is probably the best so far. The rest of the set is similar to early 78 stuff.
07-11-69   4 Although it does have the Star > Other One > Lovelight combo!
17-10-78   4 Jerry asked for banjo lessons in space. Wonderful IIHTWTG, and a show with nice structure.
17-01-78   4 Nothing really stand-out; Space and Estimated save it.
06-08-71 4.5 Killer Hard To Handle. Even more killer Other One (though a little short). The jams are generally excellent but far too short.
31-10-79   4 China > Rider opener. Jerry speaks about crowd crush. Good Shakedown 2nd set opener. Ends well.
15-01-79 4.5 Fantastic aud, and a great second set Terrapin > Playing make this worth a listen.
21-05-74 4.5 Although the 45-minute Playin' deserves a 5.
26-12-79   4 15 minute Shakedown > UJB opener? Mixed, but harder to say what is bad than what is good.
03-07-78   4 Phil: "Whoever is throwing firecrackers belongs in the Ted Nugent concert". Awful slide in Werewolves.
14-04-71 4.5 "Just exactly perfect". Great first set, nice SBD, face-melting Other One, Jerry talks to the crowd, Bobby takes a solo. Phew!
29-06-76   4 Slightly better. Not a bad jam in Playin'.
28-03-73 4.5 Star > Eyes > PITB > JB Goode?!? Nearly 5.
02-03-69   5 This is just as debauched as the previous night, and longer. The Caution explodes several times. Very minor cut at end.
03-05-87   4 Bobby high in the mix. It's a killer sound and I enjoyed almost all of it. Fun tuning in the first set as well.
21-07-74   4 The Playing jam is great but a little short. Compared to shows around it, a little more subdued. Good Wall Of Sound AUD tape.
30-11-80   4 Cooking Deal. Best Playin' for quite a while. End of set 2 has a nice China Doll but lacks energy.
02-08-69   4 A nice mellow Other One. But yet another 30 minute lovelight...!!
14-12-90   4 Another good uptempo first set. No Bruce. Nice jam out of He's Gone. Dark Star out of drums extends the space. Great Wharf Rat.
19-06-87   4 LSD warning at start of show. Great first set. Decent space as well. Not a great setlist but all the energy was there.
15-03-73   4 Only 1/2 show, Playin end fucked up. Jam and OO was good.
24-06-91   4 Also not a bad show. Help > SLip to open set one and the Estimated > Jam > UJB was pretty decent. Also a nice Dew in the 2nd set.
04-09-83   4 Great quality soundboard. More botched than normal '83 Around & Around. Generally decent, especially post drums.
30-05-71   4 Just half the show, despite being in pristine quality. Only real substance is the Truckin' > Lovelight, but it's all done very well.
19-03-77   4 Pretty good. Different feel straight away with 1977.
30-05-69 4.5 Wild, ragged and a little bit out of tune. Pretty decent, perhaps just a little too crazy! Bob does a solo in Lovelight.
13-08-75   5 No particularly mad jam, except maybe the encore, but everything about this screams "class". First set is awesome.
16-06-74   5 Another mental PITB, and that's just the 1st set.
17-02-79   4 K+D's last show. Messy in parts (Bertha / Shakedown), but some jamming was on point.
30-06-84   4 On a tennis court. Excellent pre-drums Shakdown > Playing > Terrapin. Post drums tails a bit. Another 'best 84'!
22-06-73   5 Awesome Truckin' > Other One.
24-04-71   4 "Can't you see how beautiful this all is?" and it's hard to argue, although it's yet 71 with no major jamming. Sounds great though.
12-09-90   4 UJB > Space > Drums > Dew is 52 mins. Crikey! Rest of show is no slouch either, although not to the heights of the last night.
27-09-81   4 A good show, although slightly pales in comparison to the previous night. Nice Spanish jam out of space.
21-11-70   4 Also listed as Ned's first show. Nice, but really too short. Nice late Cosmic Charlie.
23-10-73   5 Sublime set 2. Fight stops encore!
16-12-78   4 Says aud but sounds like Matrix! Overall nice energy and long songs. But not cutting enough.
03-05-72   4 First sets now really are similar - they are all great. What makes things stand out is usually a killer Pig tune or a jammy Playin'.
07-05-78   4 Nothing in particular stood apart from the great MNS, but overall not a bad show at all.
21-06-71   4 Chateau d'Herouville show. Continues the trend of being well played, good quality '71 Dead that lacks adventure and otherworldness.
27-10-91   4 First show after Bill Grahams death. Absolutly killer first set. Good pre drums jam where Jerry is not the main guitar. Decent.
17-01-68 4.5 Very short Dark Star. Best feedback jam so far, which is why so high.
23-08-71   4 These summer shows are pretty good. Band are tighter than the spring and the jamming is coming back. Especially in these Other Ones!
06-02-70   4 Cracking little Other One. Such a big change from 8 months previous.
20-01-79   4 Another Dark Star, but pretty short. Could have been better. Moore's aud is great.
28-09-72 4.5 Bass > Other One > Tiger!
18-06-83   4 Setlists recently are great. Hell In A Bucket still has issues. This would be an awesome SBD release.
18-05-72   4 Despite a Dark Star > Dew, this show felt like it had a little less energy than previous ones, and the Star didn't really go out there.
03-09-77 4.5 Infamous Raceway Park gig. Good on a lot of levels. Most songs are excellent. What a NFA as well!
29-12-77 4.5 Absolutly rocking show at the end. It's a fine fine show, only really lacking in some jam intensity. '77 in a nutshell.
26-06-73 4.5 SQ not good! Couldn't match recent shows.
01-04-91 4.5 Proper Dark Star is the real highlight, possibly the second best one of the modern era so far. Rest is decent, with good setlist.
14-03-71   4 Opening Truckin' has a jam! Decent jam out of Wharf Rat. Good Lovin' was also decent. Again though, very similar setlists.
12-04-71   4 Consistent SBDs make a big difference from 70'. Horrible cut in Hard To Handle. Phil is awesome. No big jams, but sounds great!
22-02-69   4 Tough to rate these shows as they all have similar formats and songs.
22-08-72 4.5 Mental Bass > Other One!
01-11-79 4.5 38 mins of Scarlet Fire: most jammed version? Space was good; some potential was missed though.
19-09-70   5 Great gig and the 2nd best Star of the year so far. Also rare Darkness > China Cat jam.
30-08-81   4 Lovely post-drums, very mellow and some good song choices. Other One > Stella Blue is great.
30-08-69   4 Good Dark Star, although the rest is a bit hit and miss.
21-07-90   4 Killer, spacey Bird Song to end set 1. Solid show. 3 Playing in the bands! The end of set 2 was a decent treat and held energy.
13-10-68 4.5 Still no Pigpen on these shows. They sound great though.
05-12-71 4.5 Another "best Playin' jam so far". Short, split Dark Star with the deepest space dive of the year. Too many short songs though.
08-09-90   4 Really good first set. Very meaty Eyes > Estimated > Terrapin pre drums. Good Stella Blue after drums. Solid, decent show.
28-12-91   5 Show is wrapped around a split Saturday Night. Really killer first set. Unique Playin > Same thing jam. Best 1991 show by far.
12-08-81   4 Best spanish jam and Morning Dew for a long time. Cheesy Truckin' intro got old very fast though.
01-12-73 4.5 Long Step-Back, great Playin' > UJB jam.
30-12-77   4 Some nice playing, but very very short.
14-09-90   4 Another crazy jam-fest in set 2, and the first set wasn't too bad either. Vince's high singing is a bit too high for my tastes.
02-04-73   4 Very good. Needs a longer jam. Nearly 4.5
12-08-79   4 2nd year at Red Rocks. Best Eyes jam for a long time, cracking drums. SBD runs fast though.
28-02-73 4.5 Bad SQ, horrible cuts. Best Eyes so far.
08-04-91   4 Good show from start to finish where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Good Eyes and Morning Dew in second set.
28-03-72 4.5 Long, killer Other One dominates second set, and the finishing songs are a rocking end. Everything before is merely very well played.
31-12-84   4 Crazy Shakedown opener. Throwing Stones jam is now complete. Show is out the door like a rocket, eases off later on.
16-12-94   4 Last show with Branford. Only first set is aud, thank god. A proper "out there" jam in Estimated. Even post drums is decent.
23-05-72 4.5 Playin' almost went a little spacey. Star takes a little while to get there but goes to the right places. Great laid back Dew.

5 Years Done

15-10-76   4 Keeps the energy. Not bad, but only just a 4
29-05-71   4 Famous "LSD punch" show. Show had a much more modern set-list layout. Dodgy aud for set 1, improves in set 2. Decent Other One.
19-09-90   4 Excellent jam out of Let It Grow into drums. Long second sets on this mini tour. Overall a very good show. Even Aroundx2 was decent.
05-07-69   4 Nice Dark Star in there, some decent jamming.
20-06-74   5 These shows are crazy. WRS great, Eyes jam with Slipknot.
25-06-78 4.5 Stunning (for 1978) feedback jam and chaos after drums. Solid show.
13-05-78   4 Another quite nice show. Quite a while since a really decent show though.
31-12-71   4 Decent show overall but lacks a little bit compared to recent efforts. Not quite a countdown, but first show to feel like a New Years.
17-06-91 4.5 First set starts with a 15m Eyes. Dark Star teases everywhere. Uncle John's meltdown excellent. Pretty good show, missing flow.
26-04-72 4.5 Hundred year hall. Dominated by the crazy long Other One. The jam is bookmarked by a 15 minute Truckin' > Drums to get started, and
05-04-88   4 Louie Louie from Brent. Best Smokestack Lightning ever, bar none. Decent from that point on, with a lot of energy.
23-10-80   4 Good version of the Wheel. Cracking end of second set really. The audience tape was awesome.
25-10-85   4 Deal opener? Dew opener? Not bad up until the car crash Sugar Mag. Better than others of this era, but had more potential.
19-04-82   4 Weir "8 bars". Hart: "Don't plan it, you'll forget!". Another Estimated loop-back. "More Nitrous!".
28-04-80   4 Setlists are a bit similar recently. Still, great start, Black Peter was good and high energy.
16-04-83   4 With Stephen Stills, who is a good add for the most part. Nice pre-drums jam as well. Decent second set.
05-04-71   4 Good show but a little all the place setwise. Jams are slightly hindered when they hit new songs. Lovelight is good and again long.
16-09-90 4.5 Really long Deal to end set 1. Intense, twisted He's Gone > Drums. Almost double-dips after SOTM. Crazy, even the Dew was good!
11-09-74   5 Most epic Seastones > Eyes combo.
07-09-73   5 Step-Back awesome! Eyes of the year?
08-11-69 4.5 This 69 show has a mellow Star that then goes through a series of jams into Feedback. 37 min Caution > Feedback! Tuning to end?
02-09-79 4.5 Set list is killer. Awesome return for Let It Grow. Another good Stella Blue.
26-05-73 4.5 Kezar... enough said!
05-07-81   4 Feelin Groovy jam in Shakedown, first song! Other One also good. Let down by setlist and pre-drums.
10-09-74   5 Awesome Star > Dew. Best Dew so far?
15-03-69 4.5 Cracking Dark Star. These DS are really starting to develop.
09-10-80   4 Mellow, but good for it. Also, this was the first decent sbd of the whole run. Worth a listen.
15-11-71   5 The second part of Dark Star has the jam of the year. The second has a unique best-of-class jam out of NFA. Best show of the year.
14-11-67   4 Studio outakes. Sounds well orchestrated. First Dark Star! Very short.
27-03-95   4 Short setlists, long songs. Jerry sounds like he is crying in So Many Roads. Insane Playin > UJB jam. A true 1995 scorcher!
26-01-69   4 Sound quality issues are pretty bad for first 5 minutes though.
07-04-72 4.5 Sam Cutler sounds tired in intro. Decent first set with no stand-out. Joyfull, effortless playing. Ramble on Rose is in the wrong place.
05-06-80   4 Surprisingly mellow Terrapin Jam into a decent space. Rest was typical 1980's stuff though.
09-05-78   4 Pretty bad AUD, but still a nice show. Spaces are getting interesting. "USA" chant before the encore.
13-05-72 4.5 The issue with these shows is you know where the jams will come. The face-melting jam comes in the Other One; end of set 2 is a frenzy.
08-11-79   4 Only Morning Dew of 1979 tipped this one over to 4. Lots of talking in drums/space. Short 2nd set.
16-03-73 4.5 Nearly perfect. Dreamy, laid back Star > Dew.
27-06-69   4 Nice Dark Star is the single highlight. Some strange songs.
13-02-70   5 Greatest Dark Star ever? Greatest final set ever? Possibly my favourite show.
02-05-70 4.5 Very good with killer Other One. Just lacking in space.
31-10-83   4 Last St Stephen. Drums with Airto - the best guest? It's a decent show, but has no proper jams outside space.
18-10-72   5 Perfect.
30-08-80 4.5 Finally they start a show with Stranger! Nice 1st set. Best LLR? Cracking 2nd set with high energy.
26-10-80   4 Lovely soundboard. Slow Althea. Whole second set is slow. Bobby adding lots to the Good Loving end.
18-03-91   4 First set average but pre-drums - especially the Terrapin - jams out pretty well. Baby blue encore was nice except for accordion.
17-01-79   4 Another stunning aud. Bit of an epic as well, long 2nd set. Jerry has a weak voice near end.
01-04-80   4 With April Fools Promised Land. Great Stranger and China Rider to start 2nd set.
24-03-73 4.5 SQ so-so. First China > Groovy jam. Has a Spanish jam.
12-02-86   4 Post drums also with the Nevilles. Spacey Estimated jam. Crikey, a real bass player on stage. Hand Jive is great.
17-09-70 4.5 Dreadful sound quality. Jerry directs the PA crew. First Box Of Rain? Great Dark Star.
30-12-91   4 Great first set with a top quality Bird Song to end. Second set standout Drums / Space with Airto. Vince is great this run.
22-03-90   4 Good Scarlet > Fire. Jam after Truckin is a highlight, although short; same could be said for the Other One. Full Hey Jude.
22-10-78   4 Nice NFA jam, the whole show was 'nice' but didn't go crazy anywhere. Still, has a Caution jam...
19-12-69   4 First ever acoustic is just Jerry + Bob for 4 numbers. Decent, and also the resulting set after is pretty decent.
29-07-88   4 Decent first set ends with hot Deal. Unusual China > CF > Rider. Contender for best Playin' of the 80's. Post drums lacks though.
24-02-73 4.5 Dreadful aud, great SBD. Cut up, maybe half the show. Could be a monster hidden inside.
17-04-83 4.5 Good Let It Grow and first set. One of the best Playings for a long time. Awesome space. Love the one you're with!
22-09-93 4.5 Dave Murray is the best sax player to guest. The jams are short but they sure are spacey. Has to be the show of the year.
07-05-77   4 Another good 1977 show with little jamming.
19-08-89   4 Seems like drums is getting shorter and space longer. Nice mellow pre-drums Playing jam. Excellent Other One post drums.
11-01-79   4 Maybe all auds on this tour. End of second set post drums is where the action is.
15-08-71 4.5 Another quality SBD. Snippet of White Rabbit played for audience member. Killer second set, a bit short but oh so very sweet.
12-12-73   4 Very nice (like most of '73), but no major jams.
15-01-78 4.5 Best Playin' since 1974? Great last 50 minutes. Only AUD for 2nd set though.
18-09-83   4 Polarising views on archive! Great Terrapin > D/S > Wharf Rat combo. A pretty decent show overall.
30-12-90 4.5 Holy Moly what a setlist! Funny Vince vocal slip-up. Serious, dense Playin' jam. Terrapin post drums and a rocking end.
15-07-89   4 Very long Bird song but not as good as the last one. Truly excellent Truckin' > Smokestack. Close Encounters in space.
07-07-89   4 Hot from the start. Killer MIDI in the Other One. No particular highlight as such, just a well played show overall.
18-05-68   4 Some screwed up conversation at the end. Harder jamming.
03-09-72   5 Bass solo again.
27-04-91   4 First set a bit so-so. Action picks up for second set with a great Playing > Uncle Johns. Great drums. Killer Black Peter again.
29-05-69   4 Terrible quality in large areas, but the Other One suite was pretty energetic.
27-01-68   4 Sounds like the end of 23-01, from where it cuts. Very short.
29-06-80   4 Enjoyed this one, even though it lacked in jams (the normal complaint for this period).
21-03-94   4 Car crash at end of Greatest Story. For the era, a killer set list. Monster of a Stella Blue, and best Lovelight since 1972.

6 Years Done

23-05-69   4 Star through 11 was very good, unfortunatly a 30 minute Lovelight again.
30-11-73 4.5 SQ is great. Hints of greatness. Needs more jams!
25-05-77   4 Another 4? The setlists are become a bit more modern.
28-06-83   4 Another fairly short 1st set, although it wasn't bad. Second set though, not bad at all. Another NFA chant.
24-05-70   4 First UK gig. Improvements in structure, jamming and sound quality.
08-12-73   5 Severe OO meltdown into proto Seastones.
16-09-87   4 Scarlet 2nd song in first set? Jerry goes wild in Wharf Rat. Excepting the "Blue Dress", another good 87 show.
09-06-77 4.5 Is everything just exactly perfect? Just ask Bob. Awesome Help>Slip. Maybe it nearly is. Good show.
19-10-71   4 Keiths first show and 5 new songs! First Playin' to have a jam. All the new songs are played with high energy. Jams were lacking.
22-08-68 4.5 Madness, but it's in a controlled way. Starts a little rough but Alligator onwards is top notch stuff.
06-04-87   4 Holy shit what a Jack Straw solo! Terrapin out of space? Not a bad one though. Even other One got a little funky.
04-09-67   4 Tiny snippet with first feedback jam.
14-12-71 4.5 It looks like the same set list as the last show. Delightful, playful Other One. Almost a second set. Wonderfully relaxed vibe.
14-10-80   4 "Hey Jerry, did you like the 8-ball?". Great end to 1st set. Bass solo??? Long show.
18-10-78   4 Nice Good Lovin'. Shows have picked up since Eygpt. Good, but not ground-breaking.
28-06-74   5 Best WRS ever, with MLB and Star jams.
12-12-90   4 Decent uptempo first set. Short Dark Star is not the best but nothing bad. Lacks some excitement but overall a nice show.
14-04-72   4 Copenhagen. Again it is all quality, but it is hard to distinguish best first sets since they sound similar (although all are very good).
22-04-79   4 Brent's first show. Different sound straight away. Space is great.
18-02-71 4.5 First ever Betty board! Where did this amazing band suddenly spring from? This is a cracker of a show. The beautiful jam!
19-02-73 4.5 Great second set.
06-12-71 4.5 Really great SQ. First set is great throughout. Another great Other One. Not a lot of jams but when they go, they go deep! Killer.
02-12-73   5 Intense Playin' > MLB, super mellow after. Encore is Dew!
13-11-78 4.5 PITB > Drums > Space > Black Peter > Playin' had an almost dreamy quality to it.
31-12-89   4 High energy first set - best of the year? Dark Star goes crazy 10 minutes in. Runs slighty out of steam post drums. Good fun.
09-02-79   5 Dodgy aud with a lot of hiss. Long He's Gone leads to sublime jam > drums > space. Shakedown encore!
20-11-71   4 First set not as good as recent efforts. Second set features a fairly long and robust Other One. Another China Cat jam in NFA.
23-03-81   4 Good overall show with good first set and decent versions of Playin' and Stella Blue.
27-10-71   4 Another welcome for Keith. And yet another long, very well played first set. The new songs are all bedding in very well.
11-12-72   4 Some horrible cuts but great.
24-04-72 4.5 Serious tiger meltdown in Star, possibly the deepest of the tour so far. Show has one of those annoying mini-sets after the main
08-07-78 4.5 Tiny tiny hint of Star out of space? Good show. Killer encore, and laid back throughout most.
25-07-72   4 Very solid show, although the audio starts a little rough and a large Sugar Mag cut.
18-12-93   4 Possible longest ever UJB at 23 mins, however the lengthy outro jam lacks fire. Maybe not a classic but very decent for 93.
06-10-77   4 Sources are strange. All sounds typical 77 but the NFA > Black Peter is great. Crazy key change back into NFA. Partial show.
08-01-79   4 Another aud, quite a lot in this period. Jerry's voice is shot. 2nd set like a 77 show.
23-09-72   4 Cryptical!
15-09-87   4 First set has equipment problems. Great Eyes in 2nd set - best for a long time. These shows are pretty decent.
18-09-87   4 Good Watchtower, Masterpiece and another GL > La Bamba > GL. More aggressive than usual Bird Song. Great Dew, solid.
04-05-86   4 Seems to start with last nights encore. Really good Playin' jam - 15 minutes long. Faltered a bit towards the end.
02-11-77   4 Toronto show. Short but sweet Estimated. Very rocking and powerful end to the show, and the encore was great.
20-10-83   4 Another energy-filled first set. Jerry screws up Samson and the start of Stella Blue, but rest of set is decent.
19-02-91   4 Great version of New Speedway Boogie. Most jammed Crazy Fingers? Killer Black Peter. Whole show is pretty good as a year opener.
26-06-84   4 Casey Jones opener! He's Gone is best jam of the year so far. Even keeps the action going post drums. Best of '84.
30-06-74   4 Maybe should be 4.5, Playin' is good, jam double-dips.
02-07-71   4 Yet another very high quality show from 71 - closing of the Fillmore West - that never quite goes fully over the edge at any point.
07-07-69   5 First Dark Star to lose itself to some degree. Great show.
20-09-74   4 As above, really - Needs more review.
31-07-71 4.5 First glowsticks. Killer Star in 1st set! This show has everything but the chaotic 71 setlist order fails it. Overall really good.
24-03-93 4.5 Good jam from Crazy Fingers into drums via an almost Playing reprise. Everything after drums is golden, and with a Spanish jam!
19-12-73   4 Needs more review.
11-08-87   4 Great Crazy > Samson. Pre-drums is really well done. Slightly unusual setlist, and all the better for it; a decent show.
23-02-74 4.5 No obvious stand-outs but still very good.
20-05-73 4.5 Sick semi-feedback jam before Eyes.
23-10-89   4 Starts great - the Stranger is excellent. Pre drums a little so-so but post drums is great. Best Lovelight since 72? Killer encore.
04-02-78   4 Only audience for first set. Jams are decent but lack the edge of the previous night. NFA manages to add a chord in the final chorus!
24-02-71   4 Really nice mellow vibe in the first set, unfortunatly it extends a little too long. Killer Lovelight to finish though.

7 Years Done

01-10-76   4 Good show, just needs some more energy. Great jam in Slipknot, maybe best yet.
04-07-81   4 What a setlist! Excellent Playing', with Bob led guitar jam at end. One more 4th of July.
06-09-83   4 Red Rocks 83. Help > Slip > Franklins into a Playin sandwich? Yes please! Throwing Stones jams are great recently.
19-04-86   4 2 songs pre-drums; 1 is a 15 min Playing. Long, but doesn't seem to go anywhere. Very mellow space. Clearly best of '86.
11-09-90 4.5 Killer HIAB to finish the first set. Stunning He's Gone > Spoonful jam - best ever? Rest of show can't match this monster.
16-07-90   4 Decent High Time in average first set. Another Sugar Mag > Scarlet. Great Truckin' jam pre-drums. Around x2 is back to short again.
26-10-89 4.5 Best Victim so far. 26 minutes of Dark Star, although not as good as 10/9. Whole show is pretty decent, although I've heard weirder.
13-06-80   4 Passenger has no energy. This space has feedback! Jerry out of tune in Alabama.
10-12-72   4 Awesome Playin', great show. Last Pigpen mention!
26-03-72 4.5 Cracking setlist - set 2 looks like a set 2! First major Truckin' jam. Other One jam goes places. Pretty decent from start to finish.
25-07-74 4.5 Short show, but nice Star.
07-05-80 4.5 "Playing in the Barn"; another well constructed show in Barton Hall, almost 3 years to the day.
12-10-68 4.5 Great show, but no Pigpen?
08-10-81   4 Messy soundboard. Playing > Terrapin, 26 mins of excellence. Really great space as well.
03-02-79   4 First set sbd, 2nd set aud. Nice overall show with good energy.
10-10-80   4 Excellent acoustic set. Real long show. Rare promised land end of set. Sound issues near the end.
02-02-78   4 A little short, it seems, but filled with quality.
19-02-71   4 First night without Mickey. Solid show with great sound quality. However it has to be said the flow and jamming could be better.
24-11-78 4.5 Great show with perhaps the ultimate 78 Shakedown. Avaliable on video as well.
14-11-71   4 Second set has a more traditional setlist and longish jam, although a little short. Worth a listen, they even split the Other One.
05-02-78   4 Monster, nearly 30 min Scarlet > Fire. Last 40 minutes has the 20-minute song syndrome but is done very well. Even has a Bobby joke.
19-10-81   4 Barcelona. Very unusual solo Jerry before drums. Let It Grow is well worth a listen. Best Sugar Mag?
04-02-70   4 Lots of energy, no big jams. Encore / filler with Santana / Airplane.
16-04-72   4 This is the least jammed show so far, although the Playin' may have been the better of the ones so far. As before, the first set is
05-04-69 4.5 Nice long show.
20-11-85   4 High Time in 1st set. Rare Sailor > Saint. Terrapin has jam of the year but Brent rams in "Don't Need Love" after 18 minutes.
31-12-78 4.5 This show has everything in 3 sets. Best part is post-Star in the 3rd set.
22-02-74   4 Very well played but nothing stand-out.
15-09-82 4.5 SQ sucks a little, but: weirdest first set since 1970? First Touch Of Grey. You can hear Phil. PITB everywhere.
26-12-81   4 Day at the dentist space with Eleven jam. Overall a good solid start to the new year run.
05-12-81   4 A WTF? CC Rider. Short but excellent space. One of the better 81 shows, even if the end lacks a little fire.
23-04-83   4 Funny Saint Of Circumstance mess-up. Best Other One for a long long time. Some weird stereo artifacts on the SBD.
04-10-81   4 Good overall show with a really great jam out of Scarlet that went into Playing territory.
31-03-68   4 Nice feedback jam, more snippets though...
26-02-73 4.5 Nice, relaxed, great sound.
02-11-85   4 Pretty decent first set with nice Let It Grow. Second set has a great setlist. Best Dew for a long time. Decent show.
16-03-88   4 Really solid first set. Decent Playing for the period. Pre-drums has jamming! Big improvement from the February shows.
09-10-72   4 Great Playin', but cut. Box of Rain!
04-07-89 4.5 Good first set with everything decent. Great pre drums with meaty Terrapin. Great space, killer Watchtower. Great show.
17-11-71   4 Audio is a bit iffy. Best Playin' so far. Band are having fun. Could be a great show if SQ was less erratic. Ramble On Rose encore?
27-03-72   4 Mainly a long first set, except for a totally stunning Playin' jam. What follows is decent but cannot match the energy or passion.
06-11-79   4 Quality first set. Good set list in 2nd set, helped by 20 min Playing, Still, that 1st set...
01-08-73 4.5 El Paso ruins the fun! Star > El Paso > Eyes > Dew!
11-05-69 4.5 The tape warbles, cuts, shakes and smokes energy.
21-02-73   4 High quality, no big jam.
16-07-72   4 Other One + Phil.
29-12-68   4 Tasty. Everything coming together nicely.
27-07-73 4.5 Watkins Glen Jam. Strange.
25-10-89   4 Another Playin > UJB to start set 2. Best UJB jam since 74 at least. Truckin' has a jam again! Rocked out ending as well.
21-06-80 4.5 Despite not hearing this show for 25 years, I still remember parts. Best show of the year?
15-07-84   4 First set is ok, but second is pretty decent. Jerry stays for Don't Need Love; Double encore. Phil speaks!
09-02-73   4 Professional, new songs.
18-06-67   4 Best jam so far! Just raw energy, needs a little direction.
16-07-76   4 Second set only; format seemed more usual. Not bad!
08-04-71   4 Really hard stereo but decent quality. First Second That Emotion. Short but pretty sweet Dark Star, and a decent run to the end.
04-05-91   4 Very mellow spacy jam out of Victim. Very nice Playin > UJB > Drums. Rock solid set from start to finish, encore was high energy.
25-10-69   4 Some sound issues, and it could do with a little more fire.
16-10-74   5 This show has everything.
08-10-89   4 Good show, patchy in some minor areas. But the HOTW, pre-drums and especially the Morning Dew added enough to make a good show.
09-06-73 4.5 RFK... long jams, mellow, good.
15-04-69   4 Hand-held mic, bad but not utterly dreadful. Fairly standard for the era (pretty ripping!) but the SQ stands in the way.
09-03-81   4 Both Estimated and UJB have good jams. Awesome Stella Blue. Very mellow second set.
09-10-76   4 Hey...not bad! Good feeling of energy, the first for a while.
17-03-93   4 Only 10 minutes, the Dark Star here actually cut short the excellent Playin' jam. Days Between again very good. LSD encore.
09-06-84   4 Brent has a ring modulator. Short first set. Ragged as usual now. From Playin' onwards is pretty decent.
21-10-78   4 Nice show, but it's hard to reach those 4.5 scores now. Still, Lee Oskar was good.
25-09-80   4 Acoustic first set. Jerry: "We figured wtf, might as well try". First set makes this a good one.
15-12-71 4.5 A bit short, and goes into Deal, but the Dark Star is pretty good. First Lovelight surprises as well. Overall, a very decent show.
22-01-68   4 First real Dark Star. Kinda sounding like the GD a bit. Jammy.
15-10-77   4 Nice Estimated > Drums > Other One. Out of tune US Blues.
04-08-74   5 Great Playin' and really good 2nd set.
24-02-92   4 Second set has all 4 new songs. Jam from starting from rare Other One pre drums is good. Hot drums. Oh shit, Wave to the Wind!
18-12-73   5 Ain't nobody who does what the Dead do!
27-07-82   4 Really good pre-drums, just Playin' > Terrapin for 30 mins. Decent first set as well. Good show.
30-12-78   4 Great first set. Good Hamza. St. Stephen with Mu-Tron is awesome for first 5 seconds.
14-12-80   4 Like last night, stand-out space and drums. But the overall show was better last night.
13-04-69   4 Enjoyable, not so much ragged energy. Cuts, unfortunatly.
13-04-71   4 At a Catholic youth centre! Hi energy throughout, although again this lacks any meaty jams. Phil is awesome throughout.
21-03-85   4 Arrives in a hot swirl of dolby and warble. Best first set for a long time. Nice Playin', and a decent show.
15-03-90   4 Phils 50th bday. Very mellow, long jam out of Terrapin. Wharf Rat reminded me of the 70s. Great encore, best Revolution I heard.
08-06-92   4 Again Jerry seems up for it. Decent but short first set. Nice Corrina jam and short Star after drums. Best show for a while.
26-02-90   4 Good banter in the first set. Really long 30min Scarlet > Fire and long versions of all songs pre-drums. Laid back and decent.
17-07-89   4 The main treat in this show is the pre-drums China > Rider / Playin > UJB. Even the NFA was pretty meaty. Band on fire this era!
19-03-73   4 Another consistent 73 show. They moved Casey Jones!
20-03-92   4 Reasonable first set. Decent Shakedown and the Star not too bad. It's pretty good compared to the rest of the Spring tour.
30-10-77   4 Jamming in this show was pretty decent, it just needed more. Highlight is clearly the Playing > Other One pre-drums.
17-10-74 4.5 Nice recording, not as good as last night.
25-02-90   4 Good "Last Time" - first for 25 years? No big jams, but very high quality post drums. Best Wharf Rat for a long time. Rocking.
20-02-91   4 28 minute Scarlet Fire? Drums > Jam > Space in 2nd set? Jam is unique (good) rapping jam. Very long 2nd set. End a little flat.
17-03-91   4 Good space. Truckin' > New Speedway Boogie was pretty decent. First ever Rueben & Cherise. Killer Watchtower and Black Peter.
26-09-73   4 Best horns is least horns!
13-01-80   4 Single set show. Santana and Cippolina for end of set jam. Jerry sings "Shah of Iran" in US Blues.
17-04-69   4 Other than being quite mellow in places, this is normal 69 madness in exellent sound quality.

8 Years Done

30-03-90   4 Best first set for a while. Pre drums jam is pretty decent - a good Playin' - although post drums is a little more rote. Enjoyable.
25-08-72   4 Bertha fuckup?
13-05-77   4 Good Other One and a rocking end to the show
30-10-80   4 Drums with Billy Cobham. Nice little He's Gone minor meltdown. Drums in Drums > Other One are great.
01-09-69 4.5 Starts with a fairly quiet first few songs, and then a pedal to the metal Grateful Dead finish. Even Lovelight was good!
07-06-80   4 Passenger! (although not a great version). Had some fun elements. Decent 'Saint of Circumstance'.
07-07-78   4 Very short second set (1h 5m or similar). Unusual 'Nobodies fault' jam in NFA. Not bad.
12-12-92   4 Garcia nearly loses it in the first set but rallies for great Bird Song. Great jam out of drums starts in Dark Star. Decent.
06-08-74   5 Greatest first set so far, and Spanish Jam > Other One in 2nd
21-03-73   5 Insect space Star. Best Step-Back. First Weather Report test.
13-10-80   4 Brent is great on piano here. 11th gen SBD! Cool little jam into Samson. Decent post-drums jam.
11-02-70   4 Strange mix, although Star and jam both very good.
15-04-78 4.5 Best first set start ever with Half Step > Passenger? Good Playing, only Dew of 1978. Nearly 5.
31-03-91 4.5 Bruce returns with decent keys. Killer Samson. 23 min Eyes into blistering Playing, even a Star tease there. Great space.
10-06-90   4 Really good into drums with a cracking Eyes and good Playing jam. Best SOTM so far post-drums, and even the set 1 starter was good.
31-10-80   4 Really good acoustic set, maybe the best. Killer space. Rest is a lot more normal.
01-07-73 4.5 Insane OO, Great Playin'. Hard to say what is lacking.
30-06-73   4 Tough review. Star nice but short.
27-04-69   4 Long meaty set with some decent jamming. A long Lovelight, but split as open and end. Again jamming a little repetitive.
21-03-91 4.5 Best Victim so far - totally killer. Great jam into Stir It Up. I'm really struggling to critque this show, 1991 is really strong.
12-09-81   4 Killer CC Rider solo - phew! Also a good Shakedown to start the first set, always a good sign.
21-04-72 4.5 Bremen. Filmed in a TV studio. Shortest show of the year is goofy, laid back and not really taken seriously till the Dead attempt
20-08-72   4 Other One Meltdown.
11-07-69 4.5 Nice show, and it seemed to contain a first set as well.
03-04-90 4.5 Excellent Row Jimmy (!). Brent is killing on the keys. Very jammy run into drums, culminates in an awesome Playin'. Killer.
23-08-68   4 Nice Caution > Feedback. Less Pigpen raps is good for me.
24-07-87   4 5th Dylan show! Longest Funinculi? Rare Scarlet > Playing. Dead ripping with energy. Possibly best Dylan set so far.
31-12-91   4 Final new years show. Subdued countdown. Nice Estimated > Drums. Nothing really stood out as especially good but a decent show.
06-10-81 4.5 Blues for Allah jam for Anwar Sadat? Really good Estimated jam. Stella Blue ending is also magnificent.
02-06-95   4 With the Guyoto Monks. Atonal Bird Song, proper GD. He's Gone jam tries something. Monks are great. The highs are unique and good.
14-02-68   4 Nice, and a bit trippy at points.
02-11-79   4 Lots of stage talk in jam pre drums. Another 20+ minute Franklins. Good, but greatness eludes.
20-10-89 4.5 Long show with first California Earthquake. An actual Truckin' / OO jam with meltdown? What a hidden gem, despite IWTYH post drums.
31-12-81 4.5 Sheese this is a long show with a crazy setlist. Possibly the best show of the year though. Excellent!
19-07-74 4.5 Loving me these Spanish jams.
06-05-81 4.5 Bobby Sands He's Gone. One of the very best post '74 jams so far. Rest of show suffers by comparison.
03-04-88   4 Tunings are off the hook. Great To Lay Me Down. Nicely jammed Estimated. Best Other One for a while. Patchy in places.
23-03-72   4 Another long first set. As per usual, mainly excellent. All the jamming comes in the Dark Star but it doesn't really go that far out.
13-04-88   4 Interesting Sugar Mag / Playing duel sandwich show. Show definitly peaks in the white-hot Morning Dew. Reccomended.
11-02-69 4.5 "Fuck the teeth", as Jerry just wishes to blast into jamming as quick as possible. Fiery, but even the standalone songs are done well.
21-11-78   4 Props to the clever woman in the audience. Great Truckin', pity about the sound quality.
15-05-83   4 Great first set. Airto, Flora, Cippolina guest. Modern NFA chant. Space, drums, guests and setlist are all good.
22-04-69 4.5 That's a proper show. 69 jamming is a little similar, though
24-10-79   5 Already tired of "Easy To Love You". Good "Fire". Short but sweet Playin'. Short killer 2nd set.
16-10-89 4.5 Hell of a 2nd set setlist. Long jam is interesting at start and end of pre-drums. Brent and Bob try to ruin post drums. Solid.
16-12-92   4 Nice show in the main. Another Dark Star post drums, but this cuts just as it gets good. Bob overrules Jerry at Stella Blue end!
17-06-75   4 Nice, slightly strange setlist, as you'd expect.
24-09-91   4 First Dark Star for a while. Short, and laid back but fairly decent, and leads into a good drums. 2 long Jerry songs after drums?
15-08-87   4 Solid show and a good run post-drums. Another good Dew, seems common in this period. Another good set-list as well.
22-04-77   4 Weird... better but similar, these shows.
29-09-89   4 Mellow and decent first set ends in excellent Bird Song. Lots of MIDI in Terrapin. Minimilistic space. Death Don't. Cracking.
21-11-85   4 Setlist of the year? Great Playing in the 2nd set. Second set is pretty good except last few songs. Is this encore unique?
13-01-78   4 Close Encounters themes all over this month. Space section after drums. Nasty cut at end.
23-08-69   5 Best Dark Star so far, even the massive Lovelight was good. Solid show.
09-05-81   4 Very messy Eyes, but jam afterwards was good. Great space. Screw up in Brokedown Palace encore.
31-10-71 4.5 Show has more of a first/second set split in the setlist. Great - not stellar - Dark Star, crushing ending rocks to the finish line.
15-09-85   4 Around > D/S > US Blues? A very strange show with regard to setlists, and decent for it. Super short post drums.
20-02-71   4 Much like the previous 2 nights, although that's not a bad thing. First long Lovelight for a while. Decent, need more jams.
30-08-78   4 First "Miracle". Only 2nd set. Screwed up BEW. Phil scat sings in space. Excellent IIHTWTG.
10-12-71   4 Every single show is hot now. For this one, they add some jams! Decent Good Lovin, great Other One. Blistering end to the 2nd set.
08-06-93   4 Spectacular car crash in Playin', of all songs. They make up for it in the jam after. Corrina post drums though. Not bad.
18-01-78   4 Another good Playing. Tape is not the best quality. Blackbird riff at start of encore.
24-03-70   4 Not a bad show, not erupting into highlights though.
26-06-92   4 Reasonable first set for a change (and 8 songs!). Decent, albeit short jam in the Playin'. Killer Wharf Rat end. Very decent for 92.
07-05-72   5 This show has pretty much everything. Killer jams in Playin and Other One; 2nd set has a Star > Other One jam. The Other One goes deep.
21-09-72   4 Dreamy Dark Star.
24-02-74   5 Dark Star > Dew!
09-09-91   4 No real stand-outs but the vibe is excellent; the trio pre-drums and the Morning Dew are worth checking. Very solid 1991 show.
03-02-78   5 Great first set, awesome Music Never Stopped. The jewel is the 40 minute Eyes > Playin. Best post-retirement Playin'? Could be.
29-04-72   4 Opens with a Playin', most unusual for any era. The main jam is once again a Dark Star > Sugar Mag > Caution, but I can't say that
31-03-84   4 Gratuitous echo and reverb on vocal jam out of He's Gone. New effects in space. All the new effects are great.
05-05-67   4 Powerful, full of energy, best early jam so far.
23-03-74 4.5 Another crazy Playing > UJB > Dew > UJB > Playin'!
14-05-74   5 Let It Grow > Dark Star. Crisp sound, great jam. Pure Dead.
09-11-79   4 Smoking Alabama > Promised opener. End of Dancin' pretty smooth. Gloria jam in He's Gone.

9 Years Done

27-12-87   4 Awesome pre drums selection. Drops off a bit post drums but it's still worth a listen. Decent Quinn encore as well.
18-09-91   4 Good first set, and a really good run into drums, especially with the Terrapin. Morning Dew ending is not grade A but a good add.
01-12-71 4.5 First set is a dreadful aud, excellent sbd for the second though. Other One gets to space real fast. First real hint of the future.
19-08-80   4 Slighty messy Eyes into awesome post-Eyes jam. Nice unusual set list. Playin' reprise!
02-01-70 4.5 Cracking little show to start off the year, despite a nasty Dark Star cut.
31-05-69 4.5 Better quality and better Lovelight both help in this nice show.
30-08-83   4 Intro with Kesey is quite fun. Smoothest ever Terrapin breakdown and re-intro. Throwing Stones good as well.
31-03-73   4 Short but very sweet.
22-10-89   4 Great first set contains killer Bird Song and ends with JB Goode! Space jam after Franklins pre drums. Close encounters in space.
01-11-77   4 Rocking end, but quite a short show. Truckin' was the highlight.
19-09-87   4 Excellent pre-drums, but drums is better! Best drums that I ever recall. Really really badly cut into Maggies Farm.
26-05-72   5 Audience force NFA in first set. Longest Truckin jam so far is nearly 20 minutes. Best jam of the tour in a meandering Other One.
21-04-84   4 Very decent HSF that goes straight into Playin', ruined by Don't Need Love. Very good Wharf Rat > Stones > NFA
05-06-69   5 Relaxed pacing, tunes, melodies... a nice show in admist the chaos.
14-10-77 4.5 Really helped by the 18 minute Playing, best since '74.
18-07-72 4.5 Dark Star!
29-04-80   4 Fantastic aud. Long Terrapin jam; Miracle > Bertha > Good Lovin set 2 ends suck a little though.
26-03-73   5 Sick. Jams everywhere in set 2. Post Eyes! Weather Report!
22-05-81   4 Benefit gig with John Kahn on bass. Interesting, with a few semi-decent jams. Kahn blamed for early finish.
27-09-72   4 Previous night better.
12-05-80 4.5 Raging opener. 1st sets can now be fast and furious. Excellent He's Gone jam. Very solid.
25-03-72   4 With Bo Diddly, which is ok but doesn't showcase the Dead. Dead open with 2 rarities. Once the weirdness is over, a nice show.
09-10-77 4.5 First real drums, great Sugaree and Truckin'
02-07-89   4 Playin' > Crazy Fingers to open. Faster than usual FOTD. Decent He's Gone > Eyes. Epic ending of Fantasy > Jude > Sugar Mag.
01-11-73   5 Partial. Great jamming.
26-09-81 4.5 Crazy second set setlist. Cracking show, from start to finish. Best show of 1981 so far.
02-04-82   4 Better than the previous night. Truckin' onwards was really well done and at times unique.
28-12-79   4 Best Playin' for a long time. Whistling jam in drums. Good ending but bad song selection.
16-09-78   4 You can hear Jerry call a song. Shakedown has best jam of Eygpt. Excellent drums > space.
05-05-90   4 Great opening sequence and a very good first set. Quality continues into set 2, although post drums is less so. Decent show overall.
27-03-88   4 Most bizarre start to a second set for a long long time. Eyes needs to move away from pre-drums. Nice surprises in this show.
15-02-69   5 Good development of the Dark Star, and feels almost like a full show.
18-11-72 4.5 Only second set, but great!
05-05-77   4 Rocking end, jams are contained in the songs and not between.
06-12-80   4 Strange single set acoustic for charity. Like the other 1980 acoustic sets but more talking.
18-06-74   5 Pretty mental, best Let It Grow so far. Nearly 4.5.
20-10-68 4.5 Short, blistering jams and everything kept very very tight. Excellent example of 1968.
25-11-73   4 Bid you goodnight! Needs more space.
26-09-91 4.5 Very mellow and very decent Star to open set 2. There is a lot about this show to like about, especially maybe the flow.
20-03-77   4 These seem to have more structure and energy than 1976.
13-07-84   4 Dark star encore! Rest of show is middling (though good SQ) quality. Dark Star though is good and worth a listen.


Problem shows that couldn't be found:

04-08-67   4 Monster 20 minute Viola Lee. Jerry hints at space at the end.
