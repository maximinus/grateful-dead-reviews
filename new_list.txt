A-E: How good the show is as a show.
1-5: How hot the best part is.
  +: Above average sound quality
  -: Below average sound quality

02-10-80	D3	First set is a very high quality acoustic set, complete with band argument. Second set quality is a little
				ropey. Playin fades and stops in third set. A little too low energy, the first set is terrific though.
12-05-74    D4	Below par for a 74 first set. Apparently it was super windy. Second set features a winding Other Jam but
				it ends on a Row Jimmy! Also a pretty short show for 1974. Classic year, but this is a little perfunctory.
21-12-68	C3-	Insane setlist, starts with Lovelight and then jams from there. The jams are not as wild as you would expect
				of 68'; a mellow Caution > Feedback is the highlight. Unfortunatly, tape is very hissy in the quiet sections.
12-12-70   	D3	First set is average 1970, albeit as a soundboard. The second set has a good setlist for the period, even if the actual
				songs in sequence are short. Pretty nice jamming at the end but lacks fire and exploration, and the jams are too short.
11-11-73	??? What a magnificent setlist. Opens mellow but with purpose.

25-11-79 4.5 Some space in pre-drums jam, excellent Stella Blue. Possible Jerry is drunk or high? A litle strange.
17-10-70   4 Another dodgy audience. Quietest Star ever. Show would be great in better quality.
10-09-91   4 Branford on sax for the whole show. Get for the Help > Slip. Rest is decent but isn't an instant classic. Good not great.
22-06-74 4.5 Tough call. The Playin' is fantastic. Eyes almost goes Seastones.
04-08-79 4.5 First appearence of Tiger, Althea and Lost Sailor. Good first set. Great Playin', awesome Stella Blue.
29-04-71   4 Maybe longest show up to this date? Killer Hard To Handle. Very tough to rate: excellent throughout, with a one short awesome jam.
11-07-81   4 A decent Truckin' jam for a change with a touch of Spanish. Best Truckin' of the 80's so far?
27-06-84   4 Good from the start. Long LiG to finish first set. Help > Slip! WDWDIITR a mess. Space > Dew! Solid show.
26-10-72   5 Long, glorious Playing goes many places. Only a Truckin > Star > Sugar Mag to follow! SQ a bit ropey.
20-09-70   5 Jerry on piano! Best acoustic set so far. Cutler intro again. Feedback jam!
19-05-77   4 Nothing wrong with this show, other than a slight lack of pace. Ending suite is really good.
10-05-72 4.5 Even the second set mini first-set cannot blight the Truckin' > Other One jam that precedes it. The rest is just brilliant Euro 72.
14-06-76   4 Shows are getting better, but scary space has left.
07-01-78   4 No Jerry songs at all. Long Dancin' meanders a bit then opens up. Tough to rate.
09-10-89   5 This Dark Star is almost certainly the best, and possibly, the longest jam of the 80's to date. Fantastic DDHNM post drums.
09-05-79   4 Phil wears a Pigpen t-shirt. Great Masterpiece tease/jam. 2nd set much better than the first.
25-01-69   4 The madness is real.
31-12-76 4.5 Best show of the year, but still not quite a 5!
27-12-81   4 Bobby's singing extends into the jam in Playin' - which is a good version. Weak end to the show though.
22-06-91   4 Not a bad show. Get this for the fairly decent Playing > Terrapin > D > S > Dark Star > Playing sandwich. Rest is average.
03-03-71   4 Pigpen's organ is very loud in places. However the sound stabalises and gets a lot better. Decent jamming, final few songs so-so.
16-11-70 4.5 Awesome quality for 70, and with Steve Winwood! Sounds like a real fun show.
09-07-89   4 Opens with high energy. Awesome Bird Song to end first set. Best Truckin' jam of the 80's so far. Energy level off the charts!
02-09-78   4 Good jam pre-drums, only 1 song after space which is an out-of-tune Sugar Mag.
21-02-69 4.5 Long songs, and Lovelight was a little too long. But DS + Eleven both good.
09-09-74 4.5 Tough. Short show, nearly a 5. Cut up a bit too much.
21-04-78   4 Best drums and space of the year so far. A step up from recent shows.
03-05-72   4 First sets now really are similar - they are all great. What makes things stand out is usually a killer Pig tune or a jammy Playin'.
31-03-87   4 Jerry really tries to twist the jam out of Estimated. Best Aroundx2 since the 70s? Like a steamroller to the head.
15-04-70 4.5 Super fast intense jam out of Cryptical.
28-12-90   4 Good first set, and 2nd opens with best China Rider for a long long time. Delightful jam out of He's Gone. End a little flat.
30-09-69   4 Swirl, hiss, inaudible vocals. Weir up in the mix again. First China > Rider. Cleans up a bit towards the end. Short but sweet.
19-06-91   4 Everything pre-drums is normal for the period: saved by the killer Stella Blue > Other One > JBG post drums. Other One is awesome.
18-09-70 4.5 Best acoustic Truckin'. Show gets better and better; first set is mostly missing though.
10-02-79 4.5 Noisy aud again. Eyes has got pretty fast recently. We're hotting up on this tour!
23-04-77 4.5 Rocking and good.
26-08-71   5 This is like the longest first set ever. Bob sings the "Colorado Rain" verse in Rider. Totally killer killer jam in Other One.
05-11-70 4.5 First show with Ned Lagin. Awesome set list. Terrible SQ. Possibly a 5 if the SQ was better.
08-05-81   4 Awesome setlist. Only 1 hour for first set. As a show, better than 2 nights ago, but lacked a crazy jam.
11-09-73   4 First horns (only a little). Phil great in Dark Star.
13-12-69   4 A decent quality board. Honest, quality Dead that suffers from no real jamming except in yet another mammoth Lovelight. Decent.
22-03-73 4.5 Nearly 5! Star > Eyes, Star a little short.
09-11-73   4 Needs more review. A few cuts.
27-08-72 4.5 First bass solo.
17-02-82   4 Straight out of the gate, and great quality as well! Good high energy - would reccomend.
16-05-72 4.5 Shorter show because of radio broadcast. More concise, sped up slighty? Still manages to go places. Weir dedicates Sugar Mag to Frankie.
17-11-73   4 Song selection solid...just needs more.
07-10-77   4 Only has partial show (about 90 mins). Still a pretty cracking set list and has plenty of energy.
24-06-84   4 Jerry hints Dancin' about 15 times. Excellent Minglewood. Playin' > China is great, and post drums retains energy.
28-06-76 4.5 Eyes 6 minute intro, and bass solo at end. Only 'Happiness Is Drumming'. Solid throughout.
06-12-81   4 Nothing wrong with this show, with a really good space, maybe the best of the year. Also good Sugaree.
20-09-90   5 A 30-minute monster Dark Star after drums? What a difference a year makes. Jammiest post drums since '74? Absolutly epic show.
25-10-73   5 Another crazy second set!
17-10-94   4 A bit up and down but more up than down and the ups are great for 94. Encore with Dylan, "Everyone must get stoned!". Great!
22-01-78   5 Cooking second set, even hotter after the close encounters jam. Best solo Jerry.
25-10-79 4.5 What a Shakedown! Crazy space with fairly mental bass. Not quite as killer as the previous night though.
29-04-77   4 Strange set-list pre-drums. Great HSF to start. Sound quality so-so. Interestring, not amazing.
10-09-72   4 Long and spacey.
14-03-90   4 Great first set with first Loose Lucy since 74. Pre-drums has an interesting Playin' jam. Decent start to Spring 90 tour.
20-10-90   4 Bruce solo joining LiG to Box Of Rain. Unusual Eyes > Samson join. Mellow, short Star into drums. Lacks a bit in energy levels.
25-09-91   4 Good Terrapin jam, despite missing Jerry. Mind Left Body tease out of space. Great setlist and generally a decent show overall.
04-12-71   4 Great version of Smokestack with Pigpen. Very spacey but short Other Jam is the notable highlight. Bobby screams too much sometimes.
08-05-77 4.5 It is as smooth as butter, as they say.
01-12-79   4 Slightly bizarre jam out of He's Gone - quite unusual. Lacks energy, but makes a change.
26-07-94   4 Second set starts with a decent China > Rider. Longest Estimated ever (20 mins). Very decent pre-drums. Really a decent show!
05-02-70   4 Setlists seem almost random now. Great Mason's. Nearly 4.5
20-02-82   4 Unique keyboard jam from a long Playin' into drums, also the jamming continued well into the space.
04-04-69 4.5 Very good show, lovely Eleven > Feedback.
24-06-73   5 Phil 'er up! Great Star > Eyes.
31-03-80   4 Some songs missing. First Stranger. Quite a fun audience. Great set list.
04-06-77   4 Fantastic setlist for the 2nd set; which was good, but felt like a greatest hits collection.
24-10-72   4 Nice, but too short (fragments).
05-08-74   5 Now THIS is what a Truckin' jam should be like!
07-12-79   4 Terrific fanning on MNS. Beautiful space pre-drums. Has some good touches, but doesn't sustain them.
06-05-90   4 Another great first set. Second set a bit up and down, with the Weight still in a pre-drums roll. Set 1 earns the makes here.
12-12-69   4 Is this the night before as well? 3 hours! Great quality but it takes 2 hours to get the good stuff, an Alligator > Caution jam.
04-05-81   4 Very unfortunate cut in drums space. Good show until post drums. Playin' of the year?
05-02-69 4.5 Short and crushing.
04-02-79   4 It was another decent show. Jerry has a certain "super fast licks mode" which is getting more common.
08-11-85   4 Nobody has a birthday! Really good space with weird sounds morphs into Other One with flanged voices. Great end to the show.
08-06-74   5 Awesome PITB - best so far?
13-07-76   4 Some space, and some improvements.
20-02-91   4 28 minute Scarlet Fire? Drums > Jam > Space in 2nd set? Jam is unique (good) rapping jam. Very long 2nd set. End a little flat.
20-03-91   4 Really long and decent Eyes to open set 2. Whole is pretty decent, yet another one to add to the run of good 1991 starters.
06-07-90   4 Long and energetic He's Gone jam, beats most early 80's efforts. Rest of show is more normal. Around & Around still disappoints.
04-04-91 4.5 Killer first set with great setlist. Smoking Help > Slip to start set 2. High energy raver from start to finish. Great show.
16-05-93   4 The setlist is great, and the playing is fairly decent for 93. Not a bad attempt even though Bobby's voice seems to die at the end.
31-12-77   4 Standard for the year. These shows are quite short.
21-06-87   4 Rare (now) Alabama opener. Brent's voice is gone. Unusual setlist, but done well. Masterpiece WTF. Best NFA for a long time.
14-02-69   4 Bad sound but show wasn't bad.
08-06-90   4 Great Foolish Heart jam goes into killer Drums > Sapce. Post drums slacks a bit energy wise but overall this is a good show.
04-12-73 4.5 Fantastic meltdown after Eyes.
24-09-72 4.5 Horrible Playin' cut but very impressive.
30-03-73   4 Sloppy review, SQ not great.
11-03-93   4 Always good to open with Help > Slip! Drums and Space with Ken Nordine. Days Between is a great song. Quite enjoyable.
03-01-70   4 Another nice show. Sound quality seems to have improved a little.
02-09-80   4 Another Dew - can't complain. Shows have picked up a bit and the setlists are getting better.
14-07-76   4 Things are looking up at last. Not a bad show.
20-04-69   4 Only major dissapointment was the Lovelight.
12-04-69 4.5 Another good Dark Star - the highlight, really.
05-05-81   4 Truckin' with a hint of Spanish jam in it. Second set didn't really have a clunker either.
26-12-82   4 First show with 6 string bass. Great bass sound! Hot China > Rider. Great Eyes. All round good show.
07-11-71   4 Rare appearence of the feted Dark Star > Other One combo. But it doesn't jam too hard and goes back to first set material.
11-01-78 4.5 Plenty of rocking energy, and the Playing was very good.
29-06-72 4.5 Fantastic Other One > feedback. SQ not good.
23-03-91   4 A lot less cheese recently. This is (yet another) great Spring 91 show. Decent Playin' jam and a nice Dew > Saturday Night.
27-10-79   4 Some jamming length epics, but the fire was sparked less frequently than the last 2 shows.
31-08-81   4 Pretty decent first set. Most excellent Playin' > Drums > Space. Slightly messy ending. Needs a good source.
16-09-72   4 Hard to rate, only 1 hour, nice Dark Star.
10-05-69   4 The highlights are mainly the Dark Stars in these shows.
08-06-77   5 What a nice, tasty 77 show. Jam before NFA is great.
06-06-70   4 Had potential. Great Alligator jam but too short. Bobby sells the latest record.
27-09-80   4 Bad sound quality. He's Gone > Other One leads to meltdown. Key change in Miracle?
26-12-80   4 Great Cassidy, despite being short. Spanish jam hints. Longish Playing as well.
17-05-77   4 More songs, less variation. Sets are good though.
05-12-79 4.5 2hr 5 mins for the 2nd set! Crazy Other One. Scat singing in Black Peter. 5 uptempo songs to end!
12-10-84   4 Jack-A-Roe for Phil? Gets serious after Don't Need Love. Great Uncle John's. Sound quality dips in second set.
14-02-70 4.5 This is a long show. Epic, even. First set is probably the best.
17-01-70   4 Nice show, good Star
14-08-71 4.5 Great show for Phil fans, he's everywhere on this killer board. Like a lot of 71, when they jam they go for it, but a bit too short.
31-10-91   4 Short but laid back first set. Kesey rap in Dark Star is raw and chilling. Rest of show is decent but lacks energy near the end.
27-12-89   4 Nice first set but starts to go really deep in the Playin' jam. Garcias guitar cuts out in Dew, but still a killer version.
24-05-69   4 Starts with 30 minutes of Lovelight! But the ending was good.
21-01-71   4 Aud with a faraway sound. Other One jam was pretty good, but tough to listen to. A very partial SBD exists. Would like to see more.
12-02-69 4.5 Nice fiery Alligator. No song seems to stand alone.
02-05-69   4 Fast, very furious and full of energy, but unfortunatly a bit short. No real long songs. The Eleven was the highlight.
22-11-68   4 Rough aud. This is great 68 jamming but the tape really needs to be better quality.
30-04-77   4 Good show, high energy but few jams.
06-12-73 4.5 45 minute Star was a little unexpected!
26-03-87   4 Either the mix or the sound system has changed since Summer 86 - for the better. Great first set, and decent energy all over.
16-06-90   4 Really, REALLY long jam out of Terrapin, which is mainly a Jerry space. This is a very weird second set, and that's a good thing.
01-07-78   4 Wille Nelson 4th July picnic. Unusual show with 1 long set, but still pretty good.
26-02-77   5 Awesome first set. Just a great show really.
06-02-69   4 Nice, though previous night was better
31-07-74 4.5 Best Truckin' jam I ever heard, almost a 5.
26-06-74 4.5 Longest China Rider starts with a decent jam. Truckin' is listed at 30mins but includes Other One tease. Crazy Eyes for the encore.
21-09-74 4.5 Slightly unusual set-list, majestic 17 minute Dew.
25-04-77 4.5 Terrible SQ quality, jam in second set is great.
15-05-77   4 Nice 1st set. Bit slow in middle of 2nd set.
11-04-72 4.5 Open tracks not as blistering as previous nights - could they be? Very minor BIODTL error shows how tight the band have been this tour.
10-05-78   4 Rough aud (this and the last show are DP 25). Like 77, sometimes the 4's come in batches.
04-08-67   4 Monster 20 minute Viola Lee. Jerry hints at space at the end.
18-10-74 4.5 Seastones > Star! Although end of set 2 is anti-climatic.
31-08-80   4 Solid first set. Excellent Comes A Time. Fan rips out Jerry's cables in the encore, causing a Bobby solo.
13-12-78   4 Lovely Playin' in this one. Late 78 is definitly a step up from the summer.
01-03-69   5 Absolutly crushing New Potato Caboose follows frantic Other One. Possibly more jammed in the first set, but set 2 is no slouch.
14-06-91   4 First Dark Star for a while, although this one is far too short. Space and encore are great, but could have been a lot more.
14-07-70   4 Finally, not an aud! Best acoustic of 1970 so far. Lots of cuts in 2nd set though.
05-09-82   4 US festival, start at 9:30. Good for such an early start and a short show. Start was one of the best.
30-11-79   4 Good Alabama opener and solid Dancin' in 1st set. Nothing stellar, but not a bad show.
08-11-70 4.5 First Main Ten jam. Also has first Hard To Handle jam riff, minus the song. Good show.
03-05-69   4 You can actually hear the organ on this show. High energy playing, although it's not the whole show.
28-12-78   4 Finally a crisp board. Lovelight riff at end of Eyes. Jerry tells Keith to be quiet. Killer Sugar Mag.
23-03-75   5 Up there with the best shows ever. Totally unique. Check out the radio announcer before the encore!
08-04-72   5 Cutler sounds more up for it. The band just power through set 1 like a hot knife through butter, a greatest hits collection of 70's GD.
21-03-72   4 First Playing to really get out there (and nearly 10 minutes). Some lovely free-roaming jamming. Not quite spacey enough for me.
05-08-71   4 Mainly a lovely quality. Excellent early version of Sugaree. Other Onbe > wharf Rat is the stand out, again like a long first set.
24-05-72 4.5 For Rev. Gary Davis. These Other Ones are the highlight of the jamming vehicles on this tour. Another meaty half-hour here.
06-04-89   4 Jerry is a little low in the mix. Really decent Playin' jam in set 2. Stunning intro into Built To Last. Pretty good again.
10-07-90   4 Great Loser and killer Bird Song. Power cut in Promised Land! Great (and jammy) 2nd set. Space > Other One was particularly good.
23-01-70 4.5 Lovely pace and progression. Dark Stars getting even better.
26-05-77 4.5 Nearly a 4, but better than others around this time.
16-09-66   4 Alright, this sounds like a slightly different band. Is this date correct?
11-05-72   5 6 mins into the first set and we are in space! 2nd set open with Dew. Long, LONG Star is entertaining throughout. Killer show all over.
20-11-78 4.5 Bobby was sick, misses a lot of the show. Cuts aplenty. Craziest set opener since the 60's?
17-05-74 4.5 Needs more review, but still, what a show.
14-09-74   4 Some fluffs mixed with nice jamming.
05-10-94   4 This show contains a decent first set, a wide awake Jerry, a serious jam in UJB and drums with Jerry. What a great show for 94!
18-03-77   4 Low energy or very laid back? Only Terrapin flyer. From the sublime to the ridiculous at the end.
26-10-71 4.5 The first set is so long that they have to cut the second set short. Still, it features another killer Other One. Rocking end.
28-07-82   4 Agonising St Stephen hint after drums. Decent Phil-led Other One as well. Not quite as good as last night.
13-05-73   5 SQ mix is terrible. Show is awesome from Playin' onwards.
13-12-80 4.5 Nice solid show. Great Scarlet, Playing jam was long for 1980 and Black Peter was good also.
30-03-89   4 Excellent Bird Song and great first set. He's Gone nearly 16 mins long. Even a decent Other One post drums. 89 has started well.
26-06-93   4 Nothing special until the Playin' jam, which is another decent one. Jam keeps going in Terrapin! Less exciting post drums.
18-09-90   4 Ripping opening. Best Picasso Moon to date. Jerry and Bruce led jam out of Foolish nearly hits Other One. Pretty good.
03-07-69   4 Short and a stange list but very unusually for 69 the really slow songs are clearly the best. Great High Time.
22-06-76   4 FOTM jam in Playin' led by Phil. Laid back with seemingly 2 mini second sets.
24-08-72 4.5 Another great Dark Star.
21-10-83   4 Great pre-drums continues into unique Bob + Jerry mellow guitar-off in space. First chorus for Bob? Decent.
04-12-79   4 First interesting jam out of Franklins. Great Stella Blue (as always, it seems). Not bad.
15-09-90   4 2 keyboards? Not sure if it works for me. This is a fairly high energy show, the setlist was decent and the jamming was alright.
28-09-76   4 Nice first set, and second set not too shabby either.
06-11-77   4 Killer Truckin' is the stand-out.
21-05-77 4.5 Very slick show. Not a bad number throughout. Just lacks a bit of space at the end.
12-01-79   4 Continuing the auds. Has a super-long Dancin' but it didn't grab as much as it could.
09-12-79   4 7 shows pre drums in 2nd set! Weird Playin' jam out of Saint. Very up and down, but above average.
31-12-90 4.5 Set list screams awesome. Decent first set with expected jammy Bird Song. Second set is one long party. Best New Years for a while.
10-07-89   4 Needs a longer jam in there somewhere (although UJB was 12 mins+) but hard to argue against the overall quality of this.
02-09-68   5 Great start into Star. Fine space. Betty Nelsons Organic Raspberry Farm!
28-10-72   5 Awesome Star -> End!
19-11-72 4.5 Needs more review.
15-05-78   4 Tough. Hate to keep giving these 4, but that's what it is. Nice UJB encore made a change.
28-05-77   4 Back to the standard 1977! Setlists are becoming modern.
04-02-69   4 Nice jamming, although Jerry complains a bit.
23-02-92   4 First versions of Way To Go Home (needs more pep) and Corrina. Great Playin > Terrapin leads to jungle drums. Mix was a bit so-so.
12-07-90 4.5 Long Star but it lacks a freakout session. Drums / space is excellent and the end is rocking. Definitly worth a listen.
23-01-68   4 Horrible cut, nice sound, nice jams.
31-10-85   4 Opens with Space > Werewolves! Short, but probably the best second set of 1985 so far. 2nd set has a great setlist.
12-04-70   4 Another great Viola Lee to end the show.
16-11-78   4 Worst audience for a while. Band weird from drums onward. Best Truckin' of 78? Nearly 4.5.
02-11-69   4 Nice Dark Star, rest needs a little more fire.
28-03-69 4.5 Great Dark Star, rest a little rushed.
31-03-89   4 Brent offered weed to play. Terrapin at over 16.5 minutes! Really good Morning Dew to finish the set. Even IWTYH was acceptable.
28-12-69   4 No massive jams, but its punchy sound and great dialogue make this worth it.
23-06-93 4.5 Stunning, aggressive Terrapin jam into drums. Dark Star after drums is more like an appertif. Hunter's birthday, apparently.
07-08-82 4.5 Who is Phil Ruth? Grabs from the start. Mad drums. Proper space. Excellent all-round show.
21-10-71   4 SQ is awesome. PITB is short but it's not messing about now. Star short and sweet. Keith a bit too loud in the mix. Decent show.
24-03-87   4 Energy from the off. Not a fan of these Healy ultra-mixes. High energy Terrapin. Great intro to Fantasy. A good show!
25-03-93   4 Cracking Dew tops a pretty decent second set. Maybe too many new numbers (Way to go Home after space)? but a decent show overall.
21-10-73   5 Playin' and set 2 of awesome.
29-10-73   4 Good. Eyes in first set? Strange set-list
29-10-77 4.5 Best Let It Grow since '74. Space in second set!
31-07-88   4 Decent Bird Song ends ineresting first set. IWTYH - awful. Very unusual, good, mellow drums section. Post drums is excellent.
22-10-71 4.5 Again has that 71 vibe of a really long first set, but everything is really well done. Then they slap a 30 minute Other One down!
02-02-70   5 Only a fragment... but it's the perfect fragment!
24-06-76   4 Pretty upbeat for June 76. Great quality 2nd set. Short but not shabby at all.
01-04-90   4 Even better first set than last night, killer ending. This time post drums is better than pre, with a great Stella Blue.
09-05-77   4 Almost 4.5, very smooth as well.
20-10-67   4 Recording sessions. Hissy, but well worth it. First Cryptical.
21-08-69   4 Quite mellow, and an improvement. With added flute on some tracks.
19-05-74   4 Can't remember anything bad, but no major stand-outs.
10-10-76 4.5 I'd venture to say that was actually a good show!
26-09-72 4.5 Truckin' of the year, excellent transition.
23-06-90   4 Another robust pre-drums jam fest. Great Drums and space, also full of energy. I'm getting used to regularly having good shows.
26-05-93   4 Solid opener. Finally a long meaty jam - likely the best Playing since 1988 or so, and almost on a par with 73 versions.
06-12-92   4 Here Comes Sunshine opener. Actually a decent first set for a change. Messy Samson. Good Playin' Reprise. Loud Weir but decent.
24-01-69   4 Comes with mad audience drumming chants. Also ends with drums...?
30-10-91   4 Pretty decent Eyes > Estimated > Terrapin before drums. The rest of the show is not bad, just not as good as pre-drums.
29-09-69   4 Another hissy aud, but it does contain "The Seven". You can also hear Weir on a 69 aud, which is maybe even more unusual.
30-09-72 4.5 Monster show, some cuts, good energy.
06-04-82   4 Call-response in Shakedown. Any show of this era with a Dew is normally good, despite a Truckin' whistle.
17-11-72   4 Lost in second set...
08-04-78   4 Slightly better. But these shows are starting to sound very familiar. More close encounters.
21-10-72 4.5 Incomplete, but solid fragments. Massive Phil.
18-11-78 4.5 At last a decent soundboard. Monster He's Gone > Other One. Best Other One since 1974.
05-11-77 4.5 Monster Half-Step as 2nd song. 2nd set starts Bass solo > jammy Step back > Eyes. Eases later but still a really solif show.
26-12-69   4 Billy misses first set. First acoustic set? Strange, but Star saves the day!
31-01-78   4 Good, don't know whether they are starting to sound a bit samey though. Another space.
16-07-70 4.5 Janis Joplin sits in on Lovelight. What more do you need to know? Also a SBD.
10-01-79 4.5 First East coast Dark star for a while. Good show; Star better than 31-12-78.
06-05-78   4 Awesome LLR and Deal in first set. Teddy Bears picnic riff before Terrapin. Better than average for 78.
16-05-81 4.5 Spanish jam is short but very good. Second set is better than the first, and a great UJB encore.
04-05-80   4 Good setlist, with nice little Playing jam. 1980 seems repetitive but this is just about a 4.
30-08-70   4 Cracking Easy Wind on this short TV show. Worth watching.
27-12-91   4 First set ends nicely. Terrapin jam pre-drums was decent. Best drums of the 90s? They really stand out. Pity about Around x 2.
19-07-89   4 Rocking Deal and great first set. This run is a bit of tease with no major jams. Pretty glorious run overall though.
27-12-90   4 Only an aud for the first set. Long Scarlet Fire. Stunning Estimated end jam. Hamza in drums. Messy last 2 songs though.
12-09-87   4 Great first set. Second set was no slouch either. Another good Morning Dew, and a double encore to follow.
28-08-81   4 Best Wheel ever? No flow though - highlights quite segmented. Spanish jam after drums.
22-05-77 4.5 Terrapin missing first section, pretty unique but doesn't work for me. Awesome Morning Dew at end.
24-10-71   4 Another "1971 first set", but they are really well played. Decent Star but it's literally the only jam. St.Stephen's now short.
18-05-77   4 Seems 4 is a bit common. I enjoyed the show though.
14-11-73   4 Solid...but not as good as others.
28-12-88   4 Good out the gate. Is that just the high quality though? Great Bird Song. Great space and setlist. Where did this come from?
18-03-71   4 Come for the 2 mini-jams in the second set (with the final ever feedback). Well done but repeats a lot of songs from recent gigs.
28-02-69   5 This has to have like every single major jam of the era in the massive setlist. A nearly 2 hour explosion of jamming in the 2nd set.
15-06-90   4 Great Help > Slipknot to open. Really long show for the era. Around & Around doesn't want to end. Come for the energy, not the jams.
15-06-66 4.5 "Live at Various". Great quality from the Dead Hour. They even sound like a good band!
29-03-90 4.5 The Branford show. Eyes is great. Amazingly, once in Star, he holds them back if anything. A very, very good one trick pony.
24-03-90   4 Great 2nd set pre-drums comes complete with a full Mind Left Body jam which along, with the rest of pre-drums, is the highlight.
14-01-78 4.5 Hissy SBD. But has a great tiger almost into feedback territory.
12-11-71   4 Other One is already going places 4 minutes in. Great jam in Big Railroad Blues (!). Rest of show is a lot more normal 71 fare.
04-05-72   4 Great Dark Star split jam but the appearence of a mini-second set at the end again doesn.t really work. First set is again very good,
24-03-81   4 Sound quality just so-so, but a nice mellow jam in He's Gone. Screw up in encore - Jerry says sorry.
07-03-81   4 Killer first set with 17min+ Bird Song. Interesting 2nd set jam. Energy dies away a bit after drums.
25-05-72 4.5 Excellent double punch Good Lovin / Playin' in first set. Dark Star is decent but as a show doesn't gel as well as previous night.
30-10-73 4.5 No complaints. Needs more review..
21-04-69   4 First set too many short songs, and DS did not stand out. Otherwise good.
08-05-80 4.5 Best Eyes pace for a long while. Decent 'modern' UJB. Drums > Space very on point.
10-03-93   4 Good versions of 3 new songs into drums. Decent Mind Left Body into drums. Drums onward is relaxed but totally in control.
27-02-69   5 The Live Dead Darkstar. Not the greatest Star ever but the rest of the show is also complete. Even the Lovelight is decent.
12-03-66   4 Probably wrong data, maybe December? Still, it's 3 complete songs. Nice quality and it's on point.
10-06-73 4.5 Dew opener! Great Eyes. With Allmans, so-so.
18-07-90   4 Awesome setlist. Laughing jam in drums / space. Pretty decent Other One > Dew combo at end of second set make this one stand out.
19-07-94   4 Decent first set with some energy. PITB is quite clearly the jam of the year so far. Lacks energy after drums, but decent enough.
06-09-79   4 Mind Left Body hint after NFA! Better than the previous 2 nights and good from Terrapin onwards.
23-11-79   4 Rare High Time. Great Music > Sugaree to start set 2. A bit up, a bit down, but more up than down.
21-08-68   4 Very clear Phil. Nice sound. Pigpen bits drag on. Jams are good.
12-12-78 4.5 This is a very smooth show that I enjoyed, it was very relaxed and reminded me of 74 second set ends.
06-01-78   4 Phil breaks a string. Jerry's voice pretty bad. All Bob songs in 2nd set. Fiery end.
28-11-80   4 Less Go To Heaven material is better. Nice Let It Grow > Terrapin jam, mainly mellow throughout.
18-07-89   4 High energy first set. Crazy smooth Sugar Mag > Scarlet transition. Tour is screaming for a major jam. Fiery post drums.
28-04-71 4.5 High energy set. Band sound like they are having fun. TC drops in for half a set. Dew, Star, Other One, St Stephen in the same set?
29-12-69   4 Jams appearing in some new songs straight out the box. Wildly different from early '69.
10-12-89   4 Car crash rescue in HIAB! Monster Victim. CC Rider with Spencer Davis. China-Rider and space both good. Best Stella Blue for a while.
23-06-74   4 Nice Spanish jam, but a bit short on jamming.
19-10-73   5 Star > MLB > Dew. Eyes > Stella encore!
22-10-67   4 Morning Dew start! Such a difference from a year ago.
17-04-72   4 Tivoli. Good chunk of the first set was filmed. First set doesn't quite flow as well as recent shows, although it's hard to really
10-11-85   4 Excellent Stranger to end the first set. High energy pre-drums. Short on adventure but put together well as a whole.
04-05-77   4 Jerry out of tune at start. Get this for the dreamy Playin' jam at the end of the 2nd set.
22-02-73 4.5 Great PITB, very solid. Almost a great.
24-04-78   4 Monkey drums and space is probably the best so far. The rest of the set is similar to early 78 stuff.
07-11-69   4 Although it does have the Star > Other One > Lovelight combo!
17-10-78   4 Jerry asked for banjo lessons in space. Wonderful IIHTWTG, and a show with nice structure.
17-01-78   4 Nothing really stand-out; Space and Estimated save it.
06-08-71 4.5 Killer Hard To Handle. Even more killer Other One (though a little short). The jams are generally excellent but far too short.
31-10-79   4 China > Rider opener. Jerry speaks about crowd crush. Good Shakedown 2nd set opener. Ends well.
15-01-79 4.5 Fantastic aud, and a great second set Terrapin > Playing make this worth a listen.
21-05-74 4.5 Although the 45-minute Playin' deserves a 5.
26-12-79   4 15 minute Shakedown > UJB opener? Mixed, but harder to say what is bad than what is good.
03-07-78   4 Phil: "Whoever is throwing firecrackers belongs in the Ted Nugent concert". Awful slide in Werewolves.
14-04-71 4.5 "Just exactly perfect". Great first set, nice SBD, face-melting Other One, Jerry talks to the crowd, Bobby takes a solo. Phew!
29-06-76   4 Slightly better. Not a bad jam in Playin'.
28-03-73 4.5 Star > Eyes > PITB > JB Goode?!? Nearly 5.
02-03-69   5 This is just as debauched as the previous night, and longer. The Caution explodes several times. Very minor cut at end.
03-05-87   4 Bobby high in the mix. It's a killer sound and I enjoyed almost all of it. Fun tuning in the first set as well.
21-07-74   4 The Playing jam is great but a little short. Compared to shows around it, a little more subdued. Good Wall Of Sound AUD tape.
30-11-80   4 Cooking Deal. Best Playin' for quite a while. End of set 2 has a nice China Doll but lacks energy.
02-08-69   4 A nice mellow Other One. But yet another 30 minute lovelight...!!
14-12-90   4 Another good uptempo first set. No Bruce. Nice jam out of He's Gone. Dark Star out of drums extends the space. Great Wharf Rat.
19-06-87   4 LSD warning at start of show. Great first set. Decent space as well. Not a great setlist but all the energy was there.
15-03-73   4 Only 1/2 show, Playin end fucked up. Jam and OO was good.
24-06-91   4 Also not a bad show. Help > SLip to open set one and the Estimated > Jam > UJB was pretty decent. Also a nice Dew in the 2nd set.
04-09-83   4 Great quality soundboard. More botched than normal '83 Around & Around. Generally decent, especially post drums.
30-05-71   4 Just half the show, despite being in pristine quality. Only real substance is the Truckin' > Lovelight, but it's all done very well.
19-03-77   4 Pretty good. Different feel straight away with 1977.
30-05-69 4.5 Wild, ragged and a little bit out of tune. Pretty decent, perhaps just a little too crazy! Bob does a solo in Lovelight.
13-08-75   5 No particularly mad jam, except maybe the encore, but everything about this screams "class". First set is awesome.
16-06-74   5 Another mental PITB, and that's just the 1st set.
17-02-79   4 K+D's last show. Messy in parts (Bertha / Shakedown), but some jamming was on point.
30-06-84   4 On a tennis court. Excellent pre-drums Shakdown > Playing > Terrapin. Post drums tails a bit. Another 'best 84'!
22-06-73   5 Awesome Truckin' > Other One.
24-04-71   4 "Can't you see how beautiful this all is?" and it's hard to argue, although it's yet 71 with no major jamming. Sounds great though.
12-09-90   4 UJB > Space > Drums > Dew is 52 mins. Crikey! Rest of show is no slouch either, although not to the heights of the last night.
27-09-81   4 A good show, although slightly pales in comparison to the previous night. Nice Spanish jam out of space.
21-11-70   4 Also listed as Ned's first show. Nice, but really too short. Nice late Cosmic Charlie.
23-10-73   5 Sublime set 2. Fight stops encore!
16-12-78   4 Says aud but sounds like Matrix! Overall nice energy and long songs. But not cutting enough.
07-05-78   4 Nothing in particular stood apart from the great MNS, but overall not a bad show at all.
21-06-71   4 Chateau d'Herouville show. Continues the trend of being well played, good quality '71 Dead that lacks adventure and otherworldness.
27-10-91   4 First show after Bill Grahams death. Absolutly killer first set. Good pre drums jam where Jerry is not the main guitar. Decent.
17-01-68 4.5 Very short Dark Star. Best feedback jam so far, which is why so high.
23-08-71   4 These summer shows are pretty good. Band are tighter than the spring and the jamming is coming back. Especially in these Other Ones!
06-02-70   4 Cracking little Other One. Such a big change from 8 months previous.
20-01-79   4 Another Dark Star, but pretty short. Could have been better. Moore's aud is great.
28-09-72 4.5 Bass > Other One > Tiger!
18-06-83   4 Setlists recently are great. Hell In A Bucket still has issues. This would be an awesome SBD release.
18-05-72   4 Despite a Dark Star > Dew, this show felt like it had a little less energy than previous ones, and the Star didn't really go out there.
03-09-77 4.5 Infamous Raceway Park gig. Good on a lot of levels. Most songs are excellent. What a NFA as well!
29-12-77 4.5 Absolutly rocking show at the end. It's a fine fine show, only really lacking in some jam intensity. '77 in a nutshell.
26-06-73 4.5 SQ not good! Couldn't match recent shows.
01-04-91 4.5 Proper Dark Star is the real highlight, possibly the second best one of the modern era so far. Rest is decent, with good setlist.
14-03-71   4 Opening Truckin' has a jam! Decent jam out of Wharf Rat. Good Lovin' was also decent. Again though, very similar setlists.
12-04-71   4 Consistent SBDs make a big difference from 70'. Horrible cut in Hard To Handle. Phil is awesome. No big jams, but sounds great!
22-02-69   4 Tough to rate these shows as they all have similar formats and songs.
22-08-72 4.5 Mental Bass > Other One!
01-11-79 4.5 38 mins of Scarlet Fire: most jammed version? Space was good; some potential was missed though.
19-09-70   5 Great gig and the 2nd best Star of the year so far. Also rare Darkness > China Cat jam.
30-08-81   4 Lovely post-drums, very mellow and some good song choices. Other One > Stella Blue is great.
30-08-69   4 Good Dark Star, although the rest is a bit hit and miss.
21-07-90   4 Killer, spacey Bird Song to end set 1. Solid show. 3 Playing in the bands! The end of set 2 was a decent treat and held energy.
13-10-68 4.5 Still no Pigpen on these shows. They sound great though.
05-12-71 4.5 Another "best Playin' jam so far". Short, split Dark Star with the deepest space dive of the year. Too many short songs though.
08-09-90   4 Really good first set. Very meaty Eyes > Estimated > Terrapin pre drums. Good Stella Blue after drums. Solid, decent show.
28-12-91   5 Show is wrapped around a split Saturday Night. Really killer first set. Unique Playin > Same thing jam. Best 1991 show by far.
12-08-81   4 Best spanish jam and Morning Dew for a long time. Cheesy Truckin' intro got old very fast though.
01-12-73 4.5 Long Step-Back, great Playin' > UJB jam.
30-12-77   4 Some nice playing, but very very short.
14-09-90   4 Another crazy jam-fest in set 2, and the first set wasn't too bad either. Vince's high singing is a bit too high for my tastes.
02-04-73   4 Very good. Needs a longer jam. Nearly 4.5
12-08-79   4 2nd year at Red Rocks. Best Eyes jam for a long time, cracking drums. SBD runs fast though.
28-02-73 4.5 Bad SQ, horrible cuts. Best Eyes so far.
08-04-91   4 Good show from start to finish where the whole is more than the sum of the parts. Good Eyes and Morning Dew in second set.
28-03-72 4.5 Long, killer Other One dominates second set, and the finishing songs are a rocking end. Everything before is merely very well played.
31-12-84   4 Crazy Shakedown opener. Throwing Stones jam is now complete. Show is out the door like a rocket, eases off later on.
16-12-94   4 Last show with Branford. Only first set is aud, thank god. A proper "out there" jam in Estimated. Even post drums is decent.
23-05-72 4.5 Playin' almost went a little spacey. Star takes a little while to get there but goes to the right places. Great laid back Dew.
15-10-76   4 Keeps the energy. Not bad, but only just a 4
29-05-71   4 Famous "LSD punch" show. Show had a much more modern set-list layout. Dodgy aud for set 1, improves in set 2. Decent Other One.
19-09-90   4 Excellent jam out of Let It Grow into drums. Long second sets on this mini tour. Overall a very good show. Even Aroundx2 was decent.
05-07-69   4 Nice Dark Star in there, some decent jamming.
20-06-74   5 These shows are crazy. WRS great, Eyes jam with Slipknot.
25-06-78 4.5 Stunning (for 1978) feedback jam and chaos after drums. Solid show.
13-05-78   4 Another quite nice show. Quite a while since a really decent show though.
31-12-71   4 Decent show overall but lacks a little bit compared to recent efforts. Not quite a countdown, but first show to feel like a New Years.
17-06-91 4.5 First set starts with a 15m Eyes. Dark Star teases everywhere. Uncle John's meltdown excellent. Pretty good show, missing flow.
26-04-72 4.5 Hundred year hall. Dominated by the crazy long Other One. The jam is bookmarked by a 15 minute Truckin' > Drums to get started, and
05-04-88   4 Louie Louie from Brent. Best Smokestack Lightning ever, bar none. Decent from that point on, with a lot of energy.
23-10-80   4 Good version of the Wheel. Cracking end of second set really. The audience tape was awesome.
25-10-85   4 Deal opener? Dew opener? Not bad up until the car crash Sugar Mag. Better than others of this era, but had more potential.
19-04-82   4 Weir "8 bars". Hart: "Don't plan it, you'll forget!". Another Estimated loop-back. "More Nitrous!".
28-04-80   4 Setlists are a bit similar recently. Still, great start, Black Peter was good and high energy.
16-04-83   4 With Stephen Stills, who is a good add for the most part. Nice pre-drums jam as well. Decent second set.
05-04-71   4 Good show but a little all the place setwise. Jams are slightly hindered when they hit new songs. Lovelight is good and again long.
16-09-90 4.5 Really long Deal to end set 1. Intense, twisted He's Gone > Drums. Almost double-dips after SOTM. Crazy, even the Dew was good!
11-09-74   5 Most epic Seastones > Eyes combo.
07-09-73   5 Step-Back awesome! Eyes of the year?
08-11-69 4.5 This 69 show has a mellow Star that then goes through a series of jams into Feedback. 37 min Caution > Feedback! Tuning to end?
02-09-79 4.5 Set list is killer. Awesome return for Let It Grow. Another good Stella Blue.
26-05-73 4.5 Kezar... enough said!
05-07-81   4 Feelin Groovy jam in Shakedown, first song! Other One also good. Let down by setlist and pre-drums.
10-09-74   5 Awesome Star > Dew. Best Dew so far?
15-03-69 4.5 Cracking Dark Star. These DS are really starting to develop.
09-10-80   4 Mellow, but good for it. Also, this was the first decent sbd of the whole run. Worth a listen.
15-11-71   5 The second part of Dark Star has the jam of the year. The second has a unique best-of-class jam out of NFA. Best show of the year.
14-11-67   4 Studio outakes. Sounds well orchestrated. First Dark Star! Very short.
27-03-95   4 Short setlists, long songs. Jerry sounds like he is crying in So Many Roads. Insane Playin > UJB jam. A true 1995 scorcher!
26-01-69   4 Sound quality issues are pretty bad for first 5 minutes though.
07-04-72 4.5 Sam Cutler sounds tired in intro. Decent first set with no stand-out. Joyfull, effortless playing. Ramble on Rose is in the wrong place.
05-06-80   4 Surprisingly mellow Terrapin Jam into a decent space. Rest was typical 1980's stuff though.
09-05-78   4 Pretty bad AUD, but still a nice show. Spaces are getting interesting. "USA" chant before the encore.
13-05-72 4.5 The issue with these shows is you know where the jams will come. The face-melting jam comes in the Other One; end of set 2 is a frenzy.
08-11-79   4 Only Morning Dew of 1979 tipped this one over to 4. Lots of talking in drums/space. Short 2nd set.
16-03-73 4.5 Nearly perfect. Dreamy, laid back Star > Dew.
27-06-69   4 Nice Dark Star is the single highlight. Some strange songs.
13-02-70   5 Greatest Dark Star ever? Greatest final set ever? Possibly my favourite show.
02-05-70 4.5 Very good with killer Other One. Just lacking in space.
31-10-83   4 Last St Stephen. Drums with Airto - the best guest? It's a decent show, but has no proper jams outside space.
18-10-72   5 Perfect.
30-08-80 4.5 Finally they start a show with Stranger! Nice 1st set. Best LLR? Cracking 2nd set with high energy.
26-10-80   4 Lovely soundboard. Slow Althea. Whole second set is slow. Bobby adding lots to the Good Loving end.
18-03-91   4 First set average but pre-drums - especially the Terrapin - jams out pretty well. Baby blue encore was nice except for accordion.
17-01-79   4 Another stunning aud. Bit of an epic as well, long 2nd set. Jerry has a weak voice near end.
01-04-80   4 With April Fools Promised Land. Great Stranger and China Rider to start 2nd set.
24-03-73 4.5 SQ so-so. First China > Groovy jam. Has a Spanish jam.
12-02-86   4 Post drums also with the Nevilles. Spacey Estimated jam. Crikey, a real bass player on stage. Hand Jive is great.
17-09-70 4.5 Dreadful sound quality. Jerry directs the PA crew. First Box Of Rain? Great Dark Star.
30-12-91   4 Great first set with a top quality Bird Song to end. Second set standout Drums / Space with Airto. Vince is great this run.
22-03-90   4 Good Scarlet > Fire. Jam after Truckin is a highlight, although short; same could be said for the Other One. Full Hey Jude.
22-10-78   4 Nice NFA jam, the whole show was 'nice' but didn't go crazy anywhere. Still, has a Caution jam...
19-12-69   4 First ever acoustic is just Jerry + Bob for 4 numbers. Decent, and also the resulting set after is pretty decent.
29-07-88   4 Decent first set ends with hot Deal. Unusual China > CF > Rider. Contender for best Playin' of the 80's. Post drums lacks though.
24-02-73 4.5 Dreadful aud, great SBD. Cut up, maybe half the show. Could be a monster hidden inside.
17-04-83 4.5 Good Let It Grow and first set. One of the best Playings for a long time. Awesome space. Love the one you're with!
22-09-93 4.5 Dave Murray is the best sax player to guest. The jams are short but they sure are spacey. Has to be the show of the year.
07-05-77   4 Another good 1977 show with little jamming.
19-08-89   4 Seems like drums is getting shorter and space longer. Nice mellow pre-drums Playing jam. Excellent Other One post drums.
11-01-79   4 Maybe all auds on this tour. End of second set post drums is where the action is.
15-08-71 4.5 Another quality SBD. Snippet of White Rabbit played for audience member. Killer second set, a bit short but oh so very sweet.
12-12-73   4 Very nice (like most of '73), but no major jams.
15-01-78 4.5 Best Playin' since 1974? Great last 50 minutes. Only AUD for 2nd set though.
18-09-83   4 Polarising views on archive! Great Terrapin > D/S > Wharf Rat combo. A pretty decent show overall.
30-12-90 4.5 Holy Moly what a setlist! Funny Vince vocal slip-up. Serious, dense Playin' jam. Terrapin post drums and a rocking end.
15-07-89   4 Very long Bird song but not as good as the last one. Truly excellent Truckin' > Smokestack. Close Encounters in space.
07-07-89   4 Hot from the start. Killer MIDI in the Other One. No particular highlight as such, just a well played show overall.
18-05-68   4 Some screwed up conversation at the end. Harder jamming.
03-09-72   5 Bass solo again.
27-04-91   4 First set a bit so-so. Action picks up for second set with a great Playing > Uncle Johns. Great drums. Killer Black Peter again.
29-05-69   4 Terrible quality in large areas, but the Other One suite was pretty energetic.
27-01-68   4 Sounds like the end of 23-01, from where it cuts. Very short.
29-06-80   4 Enjoyed this one, even though it lacked in jams (the normal complaint for this period).
21-03-94   4 Car crash at end of Greatest Story. For the era, a killer set list. Monster of a Stella Blue, and best Lovelight since 1972.
23-05-69   4 Star through 11 was very good, unfortunatly a 30 minute Lovelight again.
30-11-73 4.5 SQ is great. Hints of greatness. Needs more jams!
25-05-77   4 Another 4? The setlists are become a bit more modern.
28-06-83   4 Another fairly short 1st set, although it wasn't bad. Second set though, not bad at all. Another NFA chant.
24-05-70   4 First UK gig. Improvements in structure, jamming and sound quality.
08-12-73   5 Severe OO meltdown into proto Seastones.
16-09-87   4 Scarlet 2nd song in first set? Jerry goes wild in Wharf Rat. Excepting the "Blue Dress", another good 87 show.
09-06-77 4.5 Is everything just exactly perfect? Just ask Bob. Awesome Help>Slip. Maybe it nearly is. Good show.
19-10-71   4 Keiths first show and 5 new songs! First Playin' to have a jam. All the new songs are played with high energy. Jams were lacking.
22-08-68 4.5 Madness, but it's in a controlled way. Starts a little rough but Alligator onwards is top notch stuff.
06-04-87   4 Holy shit what a Jack Straw solo! Terrapin out of space? Not a bad one though. Even other One got a little funky.
04-09-67   4 Tiny snippet with first feedback jam.
14-12-71 4.5 It looks like the same set list as the last show. Delightful, playful Other One. Almost a second set. Wonderfully relaxed vibe.
14-10-80   4 "Hey Jerry, did you like the 8-ball?". Great end to 1st set. Bass solo??? Long show.
18-10-78   4 Nice Good Lovin'. Shows have picked up since Eygpt. Good, but not ground-breaking.
28-06-74   5 Best WRS ever, with MLB and Star jams.
12-12-90   4 Decent uptempo first set. Short Dark Star is not the best but nothing bad. Lacks some excitement but overall a nice show.
14-04-72   4 Copenhagen. Again it is all quality, but it is hard to distinguish best first sets since they sound similar (although all are very good).
22-04-79   4 Brent's first show. Different sound straight away. Space is great.
18-02-71 4.5 First ever Betty board! Where did this amazing band suddenly spring from? This is a cracker of a show. The beautiful jam!
19-02-73 4.5 Great second set.
06-12-71 4.5 Really great SQ. First set is great throughout. Another great Other One. Not a lot of jams but when they go, they go deep! Killer.
02-12-73   5 Intense Playin' > MLB, super mellow after. Encore is Dew!
13-11-78 4.5 PITB > Drums > Space > Black Peter > Playin' had an almost dreamy quality to it.
31-12-89   4 High energy first set - best of the year? Dark Star goes crazy 10 minutes in. Runs slighty out of steam post drums. Good fun.
09-02-79   5 Dodgy aud with a lot of hiss. Long He's Gone leads to sublime jam > drums > space. Shakedown encore!
20-11-71   4 First set not as good as recent efforts. Second set features a fairly long and robust Other One. Another China Cat jam in NFA.
23-03-81   4 Good overall show with good first set and decent versions of Playin' and Stella Blue.
27-10-71   4 Another welcome for Keith. And yet another long, very well played first set. The new songs are all bedding in very well.
11-12-72   4 Some horrible cuts but great.
24-04-72 4.5 Serious tiger meltdown in Star, possibly the deepest of the tour so far. Show has one of those annoying mini-sets after the main
08-07-78 4.5 Tiny tiny hint of Star out of space? Good show. Killer encore, and laid back throughout most.
25-07-72   4 Very solid show, although the audio starts a little rough and a large Sugar Mag cut.
18-12-93   4 Possible longest ever UJB at 23 mins, however the lengthy outro jam lacks fire. Maybe not a classic but very decent for 93.
06-10-77   4 Sources are strange. All sounds typical 77 but the NFA > Black Peter is great. Crazy key change back into NFA. Partial show.
08-01-79   4 Another aud, quite a lot in this period. Jerry's voice is shot. 2nd set like a 77 show.
23-09-72   4 Cryptical!
15-09-87   4 First set has equipment problems. Great Eyes in 2nd set - best for a long time. These shows are pretty decent.
18-09-87   4 Good Watchtower, Masterpiece and another GL > La Bamba > GL. More aggressive than usual Bird Song. Great Dew, solid.
04-05-86   4 Seems to start with last nights encore. Really good Playin' jam - 15 minutes long. Faltered a bit towards the end.
02-11-77   4 Toronto show. Short but sweet Estimated. Very rocking and powerful end to the show, and the encore was great.
20-10-83   4 Another energy-filled first set. Jerry screws up Samson and the start of Stella Blue, but rest of set is decent.
19-02-91   4 Great version of New Speedway Boogie. Most jammed Crazy Fingers? Killer Black Peter. Whole show is pretty good as a year opener.
26-06-84   4 Casey Jones opener! He's Gone is best jam of the year so far. Even keeps the action going post drums. Best of '84.
30-06-74   4 Maybe should be 4.5, Playin' is good, jam double-dips.
02-07-71   4 Yet another very high quality show from 71 - closing of the Fillmore West - that never quite goes fully over the edge at any point.
07-07-69   5 First Dark Star to lose itself to some degree. Great show.
20-09-74   4 As above, really - Needs more review.
31-07-71 4.5 First glowsticks. Killer Star in 1st set! This show has everything but the chaotic 71 setlist order fails it. Overall really good.
24-03-93 4.5 Good jam from Crazy Fingers into drums via an almost Playing reprise. Everything after drums is golden, and with a Spanish jam!
19-12-73   4 Needs more review.
11-08-87   4 Great Crazy > Samson. Pre-drums is really well done. Slightly unusual setlist, and all the better for it; a decent show.
23-02-74 4.5 No obvious stand-outs but still very good.
20-05-73 4.5 Sick semi-feedback jam before Eyes.
23-10-89   4 Starts great - the Stranger is excellent. Pre drums a little so-so but post drums is great. Best Lovelight since 72? Killer encore.
04-02-78   4 Only audience for first set. Jams are decent but lack the edge of the previous night. NFA manages to add a chord in the final chorus!
24-02-71   4 Really nice mellow vibe in the first set, unfortunatly it extends a little too long. Killer Lovelight to finish though.
01-10-76   4 Good show, just needs some more energy. Great jam in Slipknot, maybe best yet.
04-07-81   4 What a setlist! Excellent Playing', with Bob led guitar jam at end. One more 4th of July.
06-09-83   4 Red Rocks 83. Help > Slip > Franklins into a Playin sandwich? Yes please! Throwing Stones jams are great recently.
19-04-86   4 2 songs pre-drums; 1 is a 15 min Playing. Long, but doesn't seem to go anywhere. Very mellow space. Clearly best of '86.
11-09-90 4.5 Killer HIAB to finish the first set. Stunning He's Gone > Spoonful jam - best ever? Rest of show can't match this monster.
16-07-90   4 Decent High Time in average first set. Another Sugar Mag > Scarlet. Great Truckin' jam pre-drums. Around x2 is back to short again.
26-10-89 4.5 Best Victim so far. 26 minutes of Dark Star, although not as good as 10/9. Whole show is pretty decent, although I've heard weirder.
13-06-80   4 Passenger has no energy. This space has feedback! Jerry out of tune in Alabama.
10-12-72   4 Awesome Playin', great show. Last Pigpen mention!
26-03-72 4.5 Cracking setlist - set 2 looks like a set 2! First major Truckin' jam. Other One jam goes places. Pretty decent from start to finish.
25-07-74 4.5 Short show, but nice Star.
07-05-80 4.5 "Playing in the Barn"; another well constructed show in Barton Hall, almost 3 years to the day.
12-10-68 4.5 Great show, but no Pigpen?
08-10-81   4 Messy soundboard. Playing > Terrapin, 26 mins of excellence. Really great space as well.
03-02-79   4 First set sbd, 2nd set aud. Nice overall show with good energy.
10-10-80   4 Excellent acoustic set. Real long show. Rare promised land end of set. Sound issues near the end.
02-02-78   4 A little short, it seems, but filled with quality.
19-02-71   4 First night without Mickey. Solid show with great sound quality. However it has to be said the flow and jamming could be better.
24-11-78 4.5 Great show with perhaps the ultimate 78 Shakedown. Avaliable on video as well.
14-11-71   4 Second set has a more traditional setlist and longish jam, although a little short. Worth a listen, they even split the Other One.
05-02-78   4 Monster, nearly 30 min Scarlet > Fire. Last 40 minutes has the 20-minute song syndrome but is done very well. Even has a Bobby joke.
19-10-81   4 Barcelona. Very unusual solo Jerry before drums. Let It Grow is well worth a listen. Best Sugar Mag?
04-02-70   4 Lots of energy, no big jams. Encore / filler with Santana / Airplane.
16-04-72   4 This is the least jammed show so far, although the Playin' may have been the better of the ones so far. As before, the first set is
05-04-69 4.5 Nice long show.
20-11-85   4 High Time in 1st set. Rare Sailor > Saint. Terrapin has jam of the year but Brent rams in "Don't Need Love" after 18 minutes.
31-12-78 4.5 This show has everything in 3 sets. Best part is post-Star in the 3rd set.
22-02-74   4 Very well played but nothing stand-out.
15-09-82 4.5 SQ sucks a little, but: weirdest first set since 1970? First Touch Of Grey. You can hear Phil. PITB everywhere.
26-12-81   4 Day at the dentist space with Eleven jam. Overall a good solid start to the new year run.
05-12-81   4 A WTF? CC Rider. Short but excellent space. One of the better 81 shows, even if the end lacks a little fire.
23-04-83   4 Funny Saint Of Circumstance mess-up. Best Other One for a long long time. Some weird stereo artifacts on the SBD.
04-10-81   4 Good overall show with a really great jam out of Scarlet that went into Playing territory.
31-03-68   4 Nice feedback jam, more snippets though...
26-02-73 4.5 Nice, relaxed, great sound.
02-11-85   4 Pretty decent first set with nice Let It Grow. Second set has a great setlist. Best Dew for a long time. Decent show.
16-03-88   4 Really solid first set. Decent Playing for the period. Pre-drums has jamming! Big improvement from the February shows.
09-10-72   4 Great Playin', but cut. Box of Rain!
04-07-89 4.5 Good first set with everything decent. Great pre drums with meaty Terrapin. Great space, killer Watchtower. Great show.
17-11-71   4 Audio is a bit iffy. Best Playin' so far. Band are having fun. Could be a great show if SQ was less erratic. Ramble On Rose encore?
27-03-72   4 Mainly a long first set, except for a totally stunning Playin' jam. What follows is decent but cannot match the energy or passion.
06-11-79   4 Quality first set. Good set list in 2nd set, helped by 20 min Playing, Still, that 1st set...
01-08-73 4.5 El Paso ruins the fun! Star > El Paso > Eyes > Dew!
11-05-69 4.5 The tape warbles, cuts, shakes and smokes energy.
21-02-73   4 High quality, no big jam.
16-07-72   4 Other One + Phil.
29-12-68   4 Tasty. Everything coming together nicely.
27-07-73 4.5 Watkins Glen Jam. Strange.
25-10-89   4 Another Playin > UJB to start set 2. Best UJB jam since 74 at least. Truckin' has a jam again! Rocked out ending as well.
21-06-80 4.5 Despite not hearing this show for 25 years, I still remember parts. Best show of the year?
15-07-84   4 First set is ok, but second is pretty decent. Jerry stays for Don't Need Love; Double encore. Phil speaks!
09-02-73   4 Professional, new songs.
18-06-67   4 Best jam so far! Just raw energy, needs a little direction.
16-07-76   4 Second set only; format seemed more usual. Not bad!
08-04-71   4 Really hard stereo but decent quality. First Second That Emotion. Short but pretty sweet Dark Star, and a decent run to the end.
04-05-91   4 Very mellow spacy jam out of Victim. Very nice Playin > UJB > Drums. Rock solid set from start to finish, encore was high energy.
25-10-69   4 Some sound issues, and it could do with a little more fire.
16-10-74   5 This show has everything.
08-10-89   4 Good show, patchy in some minor areas. But the HOTW, pre-drums and especially the Morning Dew added enough to make a good show.
09-06-73 4.5 RFK... long jams, mellow, good.
15-04-69   4 Hand-held mic, bad but not utterly dreadful. Fairly standard for the era (pretty ripping!) but the SQ stands in the way.
09-03-81   4 Both Estimated and UJB have good jams. Awesome Stella Blue. Very mellow second set.
09-10-76   4 Hey...not bad! Good feeling of energy, the first for a while.
17-03-93   4 Only 10 minutes, the Dark Star here actually cut short the excellent Playin' jam. Days Between again very good. LSD encore.
09-06-84   4 Brent has a ring modulator. Short first set. Ragged as usual now. From Playin' onwards is pretty decent.
21-10-78   4 Nice show, but it's hard to reach those 4.5 scores now. Still, Lee Oskar was good.
25-09-80   4 Acoustic first set. Jerry: "We figured wtf, might as well try". First set makes this a good one.
15-12-71 4.5 A bit short, and goes into Deal, but the Dark Star is pretty good. First Lovelight surprises as well. Overall, a very decent show.
22-01-68   4 First real Dark Star. Kinda sounding like the GD a bit. Jammy.
15-10-77   4 Nice Estimated > Drums > Other One. Out of tune US Blues.
04-08-74   5 Great Playin' and really good 2nd set.
24-02-92   4 Second set has all 4 new songs. Jam from starting from rare Other One pre drums is good. Hot drums. Oh shit, Wave to the Wind!
18-12-73   5 Ain't nobody who does what the Dead do!
27-07-82   4 Really good pre-drums, just Playin' > Terrapin for 30 mins. Decent first set as well. Good show.
30-12-78   4 Great first set. Good Hamza. St. Stephen with Mu-Tron is awesome for first 5 seconds.
14-12-80   4 Like last night, stand-out space and drums. But the overall show was better last night.
13-04-69   4 Enjoyable, not so much ragged energy. Cuts, unfortunatly.
13-04-71   4 At a Catholic youth centre! Hi energy throughout, although again this lacks any meaty jams. Phil is awesome throughout.
21-03-85   4 Arrives in a hot swirl of dolby and warble. Best first set for a long time. Nice Playin', and a decent show.
15-03-90   4 Phils 50th bday. Very mellow, long jam out of Terrapin. Wharf Rat reminded me of the 70s. Great encore, best Revolution I heard.
08-06-92   4 Again Jerry seems up for it. Decent but short first set. Nice Corrina jam and short Star after drums. Best show for a while.
26-02-90   4 Good banter in the first set. Really long 30min Scarlet > Fire and long versions of all songs pre-drums. Laid back and decent.
17-07-89   4 The main treat in this show is the pre-drums China > Rider / Playin > UJB. Even the NFA was pretty meaty. Band on fire this era!
19-03-73   4 Another consistent 73 show. They moved Casey Jones!
20-03-92   4 Reasonable first set. Decent Shakedown and the Star not too bad. It's pretty good compared to the rest of the Spring tour.
30-10-77   4 Jamming in this show was pretty decent, it just needed more. Highlight is clearly the Playing > Other One pre-drums.
17-10-74 4.5 Nice recording, not as good as last night.
25-02-90   4 Good "Last Time" - first for 25 years? No big jams, but very high quality post drums. Best Wharf Rat for a long time. Rocking.
21-02-91   4 These setlists recently are crazy. 15m Eyes after drums? One of the best year opening runs. Just a little more variety needed.
17-03-91   4 Good space. Truckin' > New Speedway Boogie was pretty decent. First ever Rueben & Cherise. Killer Watchtower and Black Peter.
26-09-73   4 Best horns is least horns!
13-01-80   4 Single set show. Santana and Cippolina for end of set jam. Jerry sings "Shah of Iran" in US Blues.
17-04-69   4 Other than being quite mellow in places, this is normal 69 madness in exellent sound quality.
30-03-90   4 Best first set for a while. Pre drums jam is pretty decent - a good Playin' - although post drums is a little more rote. Enjoyable.
25-08-72   4 Bertha fuckup?
13-05-77   4 Good Other One and a rocking end to the show
30-10-80   4 Drums with Billy Cobham. Nice little He's Gone minor meltdown. Drums in Drums > Other One are great.
01-09-69 4.5 Starts with a fairly quiet first few songs, and then a pedal to the metal Grateful Dead finish. Even Lovelight was good!
07-06-80   4 Passenger! (although not a great version). Had some fun elements. Decent 'Saint of Circumstance'.
07-07-78   4 Very short second set (1h 5m or similar). Unusual 'Nobodies fault' jam in NFA. Not bad.
12-12-92   4 Garcia nearly loses it in the first set but rallies for great Bird Song. Great jam out of drums starts in Dark Star. Decent.
06-08-74   5 Greatest first set so far, and Spanish Jam > Other One in 2nd
21-03-73   5 Insect space Star. Best Step-Back. First Weather Report test.
13-10-80   4 Brent is great on piano here. 11th gen SBD! Cool little jam into Samson. Decent post-drums jam.
11-02-70   4 Strange mix, although Star and jam both very good.
15-04-78 4.5 Best first set start ever with Half Step > Passenger? Good Playing, only Dew of 1978. Nearly 5.
31-03-91 4.5 Bruce returns with decent keys. Killer Samson. 23 min Eyes into blistering Playing, even a Star tease there. Great space.
10-06-90   4 Really good into drums with a cracking Eyes and good Playing jam. Best SOTM so far post-drums, and even the set 1 starter was good.
31-10-80   4 Really good acoustic set, maybe the best. Killer space. Rest is a lot more normal.
01-07-73 4.5 Insane OO, Great Playin'. Hard to say what is lacking.
30-06-73   4 Tough review. Star nice but short.
27-04-69   4 Long meaty set with some decent jamming. A long Lovelight, but split as open and end. Again jamming a little repetitive.
21-03-91 4.5 Best Victim so far - totally killer. Great jam into Stir It Up. I'm really struggling to critque this show, 1991 is really strong.
12-09-81   4 Killer CC Rider solo - phew! Also a good Shakedown to start the first set, always a good sign.
21-04-72 4.5 Bremen. Filmed in a TV studio. Shortest show of the year is goofy, laid back and not really taken seriously till the Dead attempt
20-08-72   4 Other One Meltdown.
11-07-69 4.5 Nice show, and it seemed to contain a first set as well.
03-04-90 4.5 Excellent Row Jimmy (!). Brent is killing on the keys. Very jammy run into drums, culminates in an awesome Playin'. Killer.
23-08-68   4 Nice Caution > Feedback. Less Pigpen raps is good for me.
24-07-87   4 5th Dylan show! Longest Funinculi? Rare Scarlet > Playing. Dead ripping with energy. Possibly best Dylan set so far.
31-12-91   4 Final new years show. Subdued countdown. Nice Estimated > Drums. Nothing really stood out as especially good but a decent show.
06-10-81 4.5 Blues for Allah jam for Anwar Sadat? Really good Estimated jam. Stella Blue ending is also magnificent.
02-06-95   4 With the Guyoto Monks. Atonal Bird Song, proper GD. He's Gone jam tries something. Monks are great. The highs are unique and good.
14-02-68   4 Nice, and a bit trippy at points.
02-11-79   4 Lots of stage talk in jam pre drums. Another 20+ minute Franklins. Good, but greatness eludes.
20-10-89 4.5 Long show with first California Earthquake. An actual Truckin' / OO jam with meltdown? What a hidden gem, despite IWTYH post drums.
31-12-81 4.5 Sheese this is a long show with a crazy setlist. Possibly the best show of the year though. Excellent!
19-07-74 4.5 Loving me these Spanish jams.
06-05-81 4.5 Bobby Sands He's Gone. One of the very best post '74 jams so far. Rest of show suffers by comparison.
03-04-88   4 Tunings are off the hook. Great To Lay Me Down. Nicely jammed Estimated. Best Other One for a while. Patchy in places.
23-03-72   4 Another long first set. As per usual, mainly excellent. All the jamming comes in the Dark Star but it doesn't really go that far out.
13-04-88   4 Interesting Sugar Mag / Playing duel sandwich show. Show definitly peaks in the white-hot Morning Dew. Reccomended.
11-02-69 4.5 "Fuck the teeth", as Jerry just wishes to blast into jamming as quick as possible. Fiery, but even the standalone songs are done well.
21-11-78   4 Props to the clever woman in the audience. Great Truckin', pity about the sound quality.
15-05-83   4 Great first set. Airto, Flora, Cippolina guest. Modern NFA chant. Space, drums, guests and setlist are all good.
22-04-69 4.5 That's a proper show. 69 jamming is a little similar, though
24-10-79   5 Already tired of "Easy To Love You". Good "Fire". Short but sweet Playin'. Short killer 2nd set.
16-10-89 4.5 Hell of a 2nd set setlist. Long jam is interesting at start and end of pre-drums. Brent and Bob try to ruin post drums. Solid.
16-12-92   4 Nice show in the main. Another Dark Star post drums, but this cuts just as it gets good. Bob overrules Jerry at Stella Blue end!
17-06-75   4 Nice, slightly strange setlist, as you'd expect.
24-09-91   4 First Dark Star for a while. Short, and laid back but fairly decent, and leads into a good drums. 2 long Jerry songs after drums?
15-08-87   4 Solid show and a good run post-drums. Another good Dew, seems common in this period. Another good set-list as well.
22-04-77   4 Weird... better but similar, these shows.
29-09-89   4 Mellow and decent first set ends in excellent Bird Song. Lots of MIDI in Terrapin. Minimilistic space. Death Don't. Cracking.
21-11-85   4 Setlist of the year? Great Playing in the 2nd set. Second set is pretty good except last few songs. Is this encore unique?
13-01-78   4 Close Encounters themes all over this month. Space section after drums. Nasty cut at end.
23-08-69   5 Best Dark Star so far, even the massive Lovelight was good. Solid show.
09-05-81   4 Very messy Eyes, but jam afterwards was good. Great space. Screw up in Brokedown Palace encore.
31-10-71 4.5 Show has more of a first/second set split in the setlist. Great - not stellar - Dark Star, crushing ending rocks to the finish line.
15-09-85   4 Around > D/S > US Blues? A very strange show with regard to setlists, and decent for it. Super short post drums.
20-02-71   4 Much like the previous 2 nights, although that's not a bad thing. First long Lovelight for a while. Decent, need more jams.
30-08-78   4 First "Miracle". Only 2nd set. Screwed up BEW. Phil scat sings in space. Excellent IIHTWTG.
10-12-71   4 Every single show is hot now. For this one, they add some jams! Decent Good Lovin, great Other One. Blistering end to the 2nd set.
08-06-93   4 Spectacular car crash in Playin', of all songs. They make up for it in the jam after. Corrina post drums though. Not bad.
18-01-78   4 Another good Playing. Tape is not the best quality. Blackbird riff at start of encore.
24-03-70   4 Not a bad show, not erupting into highlights though.
26-06-92   4 Reasonable first set for a change (and 8 songs!). Decent, albeit short jam in the Playin'. Killer Wharf Rat end. Very decent for 92.
07-05-72   5 This show has pretty much everything. Killer jams in Playin and Other One; 2nd set has a Star > Other One jam. The Other One goes deep.
21-09-72   4 Dreamy Dark Star.
24-02-74   5 Dark Star > Dew!
09-09-91   4 No real stand-outs but the vibe is excellent; the trio pre-drums and the Morning Dew are worth checking. Very solid 1991 show.
03-02-78   5 Great first set, awesome Music Never Stopped. The jewel is the 40 minute Eyes > Playin. Best post-retirement Playin'? Could be.
29-04-72   4 Opens with a Playin', most unusual for any era. The main jam is once again a Dark Star > Sugar Mag > Caution, but I can't say that
31-03-84   4 Gratuitous echo and reverb on vocal jam out of He's Gone. New effects in space. All the new effects are great.
05-05-67   4 Powerful, full of energy, best early jam so far.
23-03-74 4.5 Another crazy Playing > UJB > Dew > UJB > Playin'!
14-05-74   5 Let It Grow > Dark Star. Crisp sound, great jam. Pure Dead.
09-11-79   4 Smoking Alabama > Promised opener. End of Dancin' pretty smooth. Gloria jam in He's Gone.
27-12-87   4 Awesome pre drums selection. Drops off a bit post drums but it's still worth a listen. Decent Quinn encore as well.
18-09-91   4 Good first set, and a really good run into drums, especially with the Terrapin. Morning Dew ending is not grade A but a good add.
01-12-71 4.5 First set is a dreadful aud, excellent sbd for the second though. Other One gets to space real fast. First real hint of the future.
19-08-80   4 Slighty messy Eyes into awesome post-Eyes jam. Nice unusual set list. Playin' reprise!
02-01-70 4.5 Cracking little show to start off the year, despite a nasty Dark Star cut.
31-05-69 4.5 Better quality and better Lovelight both help in this nice show.
30-08-83   4 Intro with Kesey is quite fun. Smoothest ever Terrapin breakdown and re-intro. Throwing Stones good as well.
31-03-73   4 Short but very sweet.
22-10-89   4 Great first set contains killer Bird Song and ends with JB Goode! Space jam after Franklins pre drums. Close encounters in space.
01-11-77   4 Rocking end, but quite a short show. Truckin' was the highlight.
19-09-87   4 Excellent pre-drums, but drums is better! Best drums that I ever recall. Really really badly cut into Maggies Farm.
26-05-72   5 Audience force NFA in first set. Longest Truckin jam so far is nearly 20 minutes. Best jam of the tour in a meandering Other One.
21-04-84   4 Very decent HSF that goes straight into Playin', ruined by Don't Need Love. Very good Wharf Rat > Stones > NFA
05-06-69   5 Relaxed pacing, tunes, melodies... a nice show in admist the chaos.
14-10-77 4.5 Really helped by the 18 minute Playing, best since '74.
18-07-72 4.5 Dark Star!
29-04-80   4 Fantastic aud. Long Terrapin jam; Miracle > Bertha > Good Lovin set 2 ends suck a little though.
26-03-73   5 Sick. Jams everywhere in set 2. Post Eyes! Weather Report!
22-05-81   4 Benefit gig with John Kahn on bass. Interesting, with a few semi-decent jams. Kahn blamed for early finish.
27-09-72   4 Previous night better.
12-05-80 4.5 Raging opener. 1st sets can now be fast and furious. Excellent He's Gone jam. Very solid.
25-03-72   4 With Bo Diddly, which is ok but doesn't showcase the Dead. Dead open with 2 rarities. Once the weirdness is over, a nice show.
09-10-77 4.5 First real drums, great Sugaree and Truckin'
02-07-89   4 Playin' > Crazy Fingers to open. Faster than usual FOTD. Decent He's Gone > Eyes. Epic ending of Fantasy > Jude > Sugar Mag.
01-11-73   5 Partial. Great jamming.
26-09-81 4.5 Crazy second set setlist. Cracking show, from start to finish. Best show of 1981 so far.
02-04-82   4 Better than the previous night. Truckin' onwards was really well done and at times unique.
28-12-79   4 Best Playin' for a long time. Whistling jam in drums. Good ending but bad song selection.
16-09-78   4 You can hear Jerry call a song. Shakedown has best jam of Eygpt. Excellent drums > space.
05-05-90   4 Great opening sequence and a very good first set. Quality continues into set 2, although post drums is less so. Decent show overall.
27-03-88   4 Most bizarre start to a second set for a long long time. Eyes needs to move away from pre-drums. Nice surprises in this show.
15-02-69   5 Good development of the Dark Star, and feels almost like a full show.
18-11-72 4.5 Only second set, but great!
05-05-77   4 Rocking end, jams are contained in the songs and not between.
06-12-80   4 Strange single set acoustic for charity. Like the other 1980 acoustic sets but more talking.
18-06-74   5 Pretty mental, best Let It Grow so far. Nearly 4.5.
20-10-68 4.5 Short, blistering jams and everything kept very very tight. Excellent example of 1968.
25-11-73   4 Bid you goodnight! Needs more space.
26-09-91 4.5 Very mellow and very decent Star to open set 2. There is a lot about this show to like about, especially maybe the flow.
20-03-77   4 These seem to have more structure and energy than 1976.
13-07-84   4 Dark star encore! Rest of show is middling (though good SQ) quality. Dark Star though is good and worth a listen.
